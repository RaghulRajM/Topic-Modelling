down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agents office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer our lowerrisk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche well have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a its another story again well cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard that doenst make sense thats what the book says we dont insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough highpressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft || ||| ~ | ||~|~ | everyones

enthusiast and so is not crossposted to miscconsumers rpw changes as of april revised brake fluid section as nonsilicone dot fluids are now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean a typically you will see something like 00hr00 the is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of ~= mm the is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s 000mph t 000mph h 000mph and v up to 000mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like 00r00 00h the indicates the pertire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum pertire loads load index max load kg note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably but may be tires with an ms mudsnow designation may have their speed rating reduced by kmh about 00mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires q my car has tires with a funny size designation 00hr000 can i put normal tires on the car a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturers recommendations q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy which end of the car should i put them on a in short and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that dont get excessive snow or who dont drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards radar detectors and speed limits q why arent there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this qa posting a because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between miscconsumers and recautos always start long tedious and pointless flame wars if you want to talk about either of these topics please subscribe to recautos or altflame and keep it there safety equipment q do airbags really work a preliminary statistics suggest the following airbags work much better than no belts good point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags + point belts work slightly better than point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the drivers hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the drivers hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do this a no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good idea a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard drivers license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us drivers test you either learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot type are older fluids dot and dot are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot fluids are not clearly superior see the next qa for more details while the requirements imply that dot fluids are better than dot fluids there may be specific cases where a dot fluid is preferable but these are mostly competition applications otherwise dot type fluids offer much improved brake pedal feel replacement once a year is recommended for dot fluids although agressive drivers may profit by changing out fluid more frequently or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid out of the brake calipers fairly regularly q what about dot brake fluids a this breaks down in to two parts the dot specification looks excellent for performance but the first dot fluids were silicone based silicone fluids are a tricky proposition unlike dot and dot fluids they do not absorb water at all while this may sound like a feature the problem is that any water present pools up in such systems interfering with braking performance and corroding any metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring the water will tend to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers where most of the corrosion occurs because of this phenomenon it is essential when converting to silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly beforehand some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot and dot fluids but i have little information at this time q abs is available on some of the cars im looking at but it costs more is it worth it a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oeequivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing absequipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steeringtriggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice dont expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions ive listed above you have to worry about the following parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for <cur> but the oe master cylinder for the absequipped version of the same car lists for over <cur> most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot silicone brake fluids in absequipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold braking business a normally id not put this in the consumers qa but recent publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers in absequipped chevy caprices suggests that this section is needed here rpw threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high performance drivers if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you cant hear the tires whine just a bit youre not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and theyll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute youll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least so if you cut the duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questions q does high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owners manual for details on what your car needs q my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owners manual many cars from the early 0000s do not actually require leaded gasoline q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use a some do and some dont during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturers opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owners manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the runofthemill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg 00k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended q what about detergent gasolines a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean a there are several different items encoded there is a twoletter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like sesfcd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number eg weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w eg 00w00 the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation 00w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter the second number is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesnt actually get thicker turn from weight to weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold weight oil as it gets hotter it doesnt get thin as fast as a 00w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all 00w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multigrade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx 00w00 oils do not retain their multigrade characteristics well over time 00w00 00w00 and 00w00 oils work very well though q are quick lube places any good a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they dont overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times q are oil additives like slick or tufoil any good a slick and tufoil are ptfebased additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the molybased additives that have been around since the early s ptfe is the chemical name for teflontm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after 0k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick dealer that slick should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick customers in the world q do synthetic oils really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you dont drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturers recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesnt get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying mile intervals if you dont drive your car much at all say miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc questions q my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break whats the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks a for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles q what causes unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause richard welty nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis carroll smith

1b7m1u,from richard welty subject recautos welcome to to the new reader keywords monthly posting replyto organization new york state institute for sebastian cabot studies expires thu may gmt lines archivename recautospart0 most recent changes march addition of altautoskarting rpw === welcome to recautos === this article is sent out automatically each month and contains a general description of the purpose of each of the automotive newsgroups and some suggested guidelines for discussions the keywords monthly posting will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities this article is posted to all autos groups but followups are directed only to recautos if you dont understand what this means ask your system administrator for help or at least for copies of the newuser documentation failing that please subscribe to the newsgroup newsannouncenewusers and read the documentation provided there introduction to the recautos newsgroup hierarchy recautostech is intended for technical discussions of automobiles their design construction diagnosis and service other discussions are largely inappropriate especially for sale ads recautossport is intended for discussion of legal organized competition involving automobiles technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles discussion from either of two viewpoints spectator and participant is encouraged arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate as are most other discussions for sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles andor equipment discussions of illegal events are marginal one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law remember the fbi reads usenet recautosdriving is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles also if you must discuss vs or radar detectors or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads do it here recautosvw is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by volkswagen this includes vws audis seats etc it was created on the grounds that the infovw mailing list was very successful it should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as a mailing list recaudiocar is not properly part of the recautos hierarchy it is however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so is mentioned here recautosantique is intended for the discussion of older cars usually more than years old although this is not a hardandfast rule althotrod is not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the recautos reader it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles altautosrodncustom also not part of the official hierarchy devoted to that peculiar american hobby of customizing older cars altautoskarting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting recautos is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics crossposting crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the newsgroups line in the article header such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on usenet you should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach a particular audience this distinction is subtle but important radar detector articles for example are moreorless appropriate in recautos they are almost never appropriate in scielectronics or rechamradio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in scielectronics or rechamradio is not adequate justification for posting to either group crossposting between any or all of the recautos groups is usually inappropriate if you find yourself doing so consider whether or not it is truly advisable before sending your article consider setting followupto to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost crossposting between recautos and miscconsumers is chancy at best in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the us andor the use of radar detectors should never be crossposted between any of these groups most readers of scielectronics and recradio couldnt care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in recautos it is an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followupto lines of articles before posting a followup in particular be wary of posting to misctest recartsstartrek or talkbizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own distribution there is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to partially control where the article goes it is called the distribution field it may be very useful for many reasons it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system the distribution of recautos is fairly extensive as of this writing the automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some locations in japan with this in mind i offer the following hints about use of the distribution field in your article headers and on article content please take care not to send forsale ads about clapped out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california i doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason likes mavericks but only door mavericks at that when posting technical questions please include the market for which your car was manufactured for example there are a number of differences between a europeanmarket ford escort and a usmarket escort likewise all 0000cc and early 0000cc alfa romeos reached the us with spica fuel injection european market cars usually got carbs often webers these differences can be important to your readers make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting in the us we get a mix of metric and english system values whereas europe is almost entirely on the metric system a future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonlyused abbreviations that may not be known in some places that recautos reaches this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it use the distribution field to limit where your article goes when possible within north america the values na north america can canada and usa may be used in addition the twoletter state abbreviations of the us are supported in some cases eg if i wanted to send an article only to new york and new jersey i could put nynj in a distribution field note that multiple commaseparated values are legal these distribution fields vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area the dangers of overgeneralization to amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars tires etc what is true for a buick with a 000cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a honda with a 0000cc engine headlight laws in sweden are decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask a question please give a reasonable amount of information eg if you have a question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answers to your question may be quite useless concerning lemons at one time or another every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two even honda admits to this please dont waste everyones time by announcing to the world that your brand x automobile is terrible so all brand x automobiles are terrible so no one should ever buy a car from the brand x company such articles are worse than useless because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information concerning flames as much as we might wish it a flamefree newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them a list of flameprone topics follows in the next section of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory dont imagine for a minute that including the words no flames will work it wont and youll get exactly what you deserve if youre going to flame youre more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a wellknown reference no one is likely to believe bald unsupported assertions be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insulting anyone asking the question it is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like please send email i dont read this group it is a much better idea to end the question with please send email if there is sufficient interest ill summarize the results in a later posting i may miss posted responses to this request answering the question if someone wants to hop up their yugo dont tell them to get a mustang either be silent or give them useful advice if someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket dont tell them to obey the law next time its offensive presumes guilt which is not proven and doesnt directly address the original question in general dont post in order to see your words in print and dont post in order to enjoy feeling smug and selfrighteous stale andor inflammatory topics certain topics are considered stale by old timers while discussion of them is certainly ok and new factual information is welcome ravings about them are extremely tiresome and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether some topics are naturally inflammatory it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them some of these topics include the following the 00mph speed limit in the us pro and con discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detectors discussions over which radar detector is best discussions over what is a sports car this is one reason why recautossport is not a sports car group everyone would argue about what constitutes a sports car disputes over whether or not us federal law protects the drivers right to own and operate a radar detector buy american discussions clever bumper stickers and personalized license plates <insert nationality here> cars are terrible what kind of car did maxwell smart drive when i have a complete accurate answer it will be added to the commonlyasked questions article which is also posted monthly until then please dont waste bandwidth on this topic rpw please direct comments and suggestions about this article to richard welty nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of a race car about either its pitch or roll axis carroll smith

babied it i pampered it and after years it just couldnt stay together i would say that not everyone will have the problems that i had but know this its not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chryslerdodgetake your pick dealer i dont care if there are going to reform their dealersservice with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it case and point the local dodge dealer you drive up just looking you dont even get out of your door when about yes salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service is about times worse than that i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about dollars of workparts to fix it let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldnt have been dodge shadow es these were replaced within the years that i owned the car engine alternators rear suspension torsion bar water pumps thermostats hall effect sensor main computer batteries these were rebuiltrepaired radiator automatic transmission power steering those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself its a good car i just cant find anybody competent enough the fix it in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again i just stopped putting money into it i must have put at least <cur><cur> worth of repairs over its lifetime i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn i will not touch another chrysler product again no way i dont care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gm isnt much better thank god they dont control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy dont get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next years i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me but since someone else pointed out cd as a source i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated kcar and engine whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars no car magazine is really objective and although there are alot of people who dont like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadowsundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chryslers rate a better than average i think the best one is just average excluding the diamond starmitsubishi stuff and the lhs you can find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company i read an article which had a subcolumn an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created they are still struggling because they havent learned yet they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out its called competition gentlemanwomen if you dont satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out asbestos suit on gaia

6i7v8h,from richard welty subject recautos frequently asked questions keywords monthly posting replyto organization new york state institute for sebastian cabot studies expires thu may gmt lines archivename recautospart0 this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly asked automotive questions the other article contains questions of general consumer interest and is broken out to facilitate crossposting to miscconsumers rpw last change february ct now permits radar detector usage new tiretraction qa rpw commonly asked questions radar questions q where are radar detectors illegal a in the us currently virgina and the district of columbia prohibit all usage of radar detectors new york prohibits their use in large trucks in canada they are illegal in manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland and pei prince edward island they are apparently are illegal through most if not all of europe legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other jurisdictions chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal q where are radar detector detectors used do they really work a usage is spreading rapidly initially they were used only in canada but now they are appearing in new york and virginia it is unsafe to assume that they are not in use in connecticut and dc they work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently available super het radar detectors some brands of detector radiate more strongly than others and are thus more likely to be spotted new radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected by the current generation of detector detectors note that a detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned on q what is vascar is it some kind of radar a vascar is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and timespeeddistance computer it depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target vehicle passes landmarks no radar signals are emitted by a vascar system q what is ka band radar where is it used should a radar detector be able to handle it a ka band has recently been made available by the fcc for use in the us in socalled photoradar installations in these installations a lowpowered beam is aimed across the road at a degree angle to the direction of traffic and a picture is taken of vehicles which the radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle because of the low power and the degree angle many people believe that a radar detector cannot give reasonable warning of a ka band radar unit although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such capability anyway the number of locales where photoradar is in use is limited and some question the legality of such units best advice learn what photo radar units look like and keep track of where they are used or else dont speed q do radar jammers work are they legal a quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammers do not work well at all jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the military jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the federal communications commission of the usa driving technique and vehicle dynamics questions q what are understeer and oversteer a understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a car while cornering near the limit limit of adhesion that is most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to be descriptive of the situations they encounter simply put they tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner steer less or understeer or it wants to turn more in a corner oversteer understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling too fast wont get into trouble understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle in a corner oversteer is designed into some more performance oriented cars it may be induced by lifting on the throttle trailing throttle oversteer or tto in extreme cases lifting on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or spinning some technical details in a corner at speed the tires on the car will develop what are called slip angles the slip angle is the angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to travel in understeer the front wheels have a greater slip angle than the rear wheels in oversteer the rear wheels have a greater slip angle than the front wheels q what is a revmatched downshift a when downshifting the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear than it was in the higher gear however during a downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase in revmatched downshift you blip the throttle before reengaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this results in a much smoother and faster downshift q what does heelandtoe mean a heelandtoe is a technique used to do a revmatched downshift while braking this is normally challenging because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it is called heelandtoe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift in many modern cars this is a misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch and just use the left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplishing the same thing q what is doubleclutch downshifting a while your right foot is doing the above your left foot can do one of three things nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the transmission to the speed of the engine this is usually coupled with revmatching so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch engaged the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission speed up the procedure is as follows declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever to next lower gear engage clutch this sounds like a lot of work but with practice it becomes natural the problem that doubleclutching solves is normally the function of the synchronizers within the gearbox in transmissions without synchros or with very worn synchros doubleclutching makes it much easier to shift basically if you doubleclutch well you are not using the synchros at all this is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good condition q what do the numbers for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom times in the auto magazines really mean may they be compared a in short not as much as the magazines want you to believe and almost never in more detail the acceleration numbers 00mph and mile times in the us may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the same source testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine that comparing a road track number to a car driver number is quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation applies from driver to driver on the street the driver is a major often the major part of the equation skidpads vary and even if they didnt skidpad figures are really only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires they change radically when tire compounds change do not make any assumptions about the comparative handling of say two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers this is not to suggest that skidpads are without value however skidpads are an excellent educational tool at driving schools they are simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires slalom times are slightly more useful they test some small parts of the automobiles transient response however they are also heavily influenced by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corners of the cars envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before making a buying decision for example they dont tell you what the rear end of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes offcamber when a car has an adjustable suspension these tests are usually done in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving the list of caveats could go on for page after page q my buddy claims that wide tires dont make any difference according to his freshman physics textbook and that you cant ever accelerate or corner at more than 0g does he know what hes talking about a in short he hasnt got a clue in more detail the equations for friction used in freshman physics textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth dry and nondeformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating temperature pavement is never smooth it is always irregular to a greater or lesser extent tires which are not really dry and solid as rubber is a substance which in its natural form is liquid and which has only been coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over in a tire at operating temperature grip is actually generated by shear stresses inside the deformed rubber and not by anything even remotely resembling friction in the freshman physics sense of the term the colder a tire is relative to its operating temperature the closer its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hotter than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually reverting to liquid which is mostly like to happen deep in the tread causing characteristic blisters and chunking this latter though is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless youre a competition driver or do a lot of high speed track driving dont worry about it because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragsters accelerate at more than 0g and race cars corner and brake at more than 0g because simple friction does not apply it is actually possible for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism misc questions q what does <name or acronym> stand for a here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked about be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names as misinformation abounds on the net in particular never ask in rechumor if you want a useful result saab svenska aeroplan a b or the swedish airplane corporation alfa societa anonima lombarda fabbrica automobili or the lombardy automobile manufacturing company fiat fabbrica italiana di automobili torino or the italian automobile manufacturers of turin bmw bayerische motoren werke or bavarian motor works mg morris garage q does vw own porsche a no porsche is a publicly held company controlled by the

9q3o7t,pros:Overall a pleasant experience and I bonded with my co workers in a very safe and friendly atmosphere. cons:I did find Dan to be quite abrasive at times. No fault to him though. I can also be abrasive at times.
1e9o9c,"pros:Great people, most everyone was very supportive and helpful. cons:Upper management and the HR dept."
5g3g2h,pros:The people you work with are good people inside and outside of work cons:More frequent furloughs and layoffs with hiring freeze. Doesn't matter if you performed excellent before performance review time there is no raise because of pay freeze. Low staff resources but the company still have the same expectation as if they are fully staffed.
6n2j9g,"pros:large company,Some training potential for younger engineers. cons:Management is minimizing in-house development.Philosophy is for reuse of what is already known.Buying companies/knowledge is the business strategy."
7i3o2m,"pros:Design is new for Honeywell (the CEO made a statement about wanting Honeywell to be 'the Apple of Industrials' so there is a lot to do there. Honeywell essentially buys smaller companies and lets them run, so as a designer you can step in and help them build better products and experiences. cons:The industrial design management is horrific and created a toxic work environment. ID management's style is essentially a bat about the head and neck. ID management uses verbal abuse as the primary management tool, followed up by tirades and berating language. ID management lies about what is expected from you, making things like deliverables change from day to day. ID management has unrealistic and hidden expectations about how design and designers should work, and uses that against the designers. ID management takes no responsibility for anything as far as I could tell.Here is an example: I met ID management at one of the Honeywell subsidiaries in the suburbs of a major midwestern city for a kick off meeting around designing new fire control systems. This is a typical product development meeting, where the designers meet with engineers to understand technical limitations (manufacturing electronics etc) and meet with product management, who own the business side of the products (what it needs to do, and cost and who its for). These meetings are what they sound like, a kick off- a chance to meet your product development partners and get on the same page. Designers typically leave these meetings and put plans to gather for the project; schedule, process resources etc.I walked into this facility and ID management pulled me aside immediately into an empty office and began dressing me down about why I had not brought a presentation to show these people. I was horrified that I had missed this assignment and had no idea what ID management was referring to- it was a kick off meeting, we were there to learn. Then it became apparent this was one more wacky mind game. As I caught myself I realized no one even asked me if I had a presentation, ID management just laid into me for NOT having a presentation.That is the type of mind games I constantly endured at Honeywell, and the type of behavior Honeywell believes makes them successful. As a designer please stay away. It is a stifling and crushing creative environment. ID management is doing nothing that remotely looks like it's heading Honeywell toward the 'Apple of the Industrials'.In short its the worst job I have EVER had in my life. And I have had some lame jobs."
1k0s8d,pros:Having the name Honeywell on your resume cons:Actually working for Honeywell and having their super expensive and ridiculous health insurance.
6r4p2z,"pros:Get to dig in and own P&L for large business with significant resources. The staff is intelligent and capable making conversation of technical aspects easier. cons:Do not value employees, slow moving means most technology is not cutting edge. Poor benefits and numerous organizational changes. Inner company job changes are not encouraged and being pigeon holed is common."
7w4s8q,"pros:Good Entry-level Opportunities for recent graduates. cons:None cons; fair employer, great peers, awesome work values."
6z4u4y,pros:Good comradeship and highly technology business that provides employees with a sense of accomplishment. Reasonably OK and benefits but most employees reason for working there is their sense of accomplishment on high technology programs cons:Old industrial company that has become exceptionally risk averse. Recently the company morale has become sluggish due to frequent unpaid work interruptions and the associated expectation for future losses in personal income predictability
9r2v1r,"pros:Challenging work, 401K, a lot of opportunities. cons:Difficult to balance work and life."
4o5h7y,"pros:Very few. Some smart people left but not for long cons:No focus on people, innovation or long term. If you want to drive short term profits and want to focus only on numbers, this is your place."
1s2r5q,"pros:Good place to gain experience in basic engineering practices and processes. There's opportunity for growth within certain segments. cons:The bottom line numbers trump everything; practices to show growth/revenue targets were met go to the point of being detrimental to the long term viability of the business. Aside from deleterious accounting/business decisions, three furloughs and two layoffs in 2016 within the Aerospace unit did little to raise the declining morale."

I definitely do not get bored working here. cons:In the 18 months or so I've worked here, there have been 4 furloughs, 3 layoffs, a decision for no raises, increased health insurance with reduced coverage, and a new ban on working remotely. They've eliminated nearly every benefit there is to working at Honeywell. Employees and their happiness are the absolute lowest priority at Honeywell."

2b4m6a,"pros:The team I am on invested in hiring experienced professionals to build skilled teams in support of big initiatives. They also just started a great new onboarding program for new hires and the HR tools are very easy to use. There is also great technology, software's and infrastructure to support global collaboration. cons:There is no work space / office space for new (and many existing) employees"

It's a true American company. I have great respect for all Honeywell employee and hope I can part of this team. cons:Meeting new people for the first time and hoping that they will be friendly . But it's hard to say but I have to be positive

3c6y9z,"pros:Great management support,Great pay,Opportunities to branch out within fieldWould definitely recommend the company/position all in all cons:No pensions,Salary growth year to year is slow,Upward movement isn't always clear,Surrounding union environment complicates things (position is non-union)"
5p0w9i,pros:Employee Benefits are top notch. cons:Career Growth is very limited.
9u2z3a,"pros:I thought the interview process and onboarding was great. Everyone in the company is so eager to help, and they have all been welcoming. I am on my second week, and from the IT department to the payroll support and of course the great manager I have this has been a great experience so far. The company expects high performance and people who are focused on profitability, but that is why they are successful. cons:I came from a much smaller company and it was a bit overwhelming to be in a large company where they have detailed processes and telephone hotlines for everything. I do have to say though once I got into the groove every department has been very supportive and highly professional. The support is there and it works if you just use the tools they give you."
5n8g8s,"pros:The teams were working on very interesting projects that truly are used in the world. It is fascinating. The teams are very colloquial and comfortable with each other, therefore it doesn't seems too uptight. I loved my boss. cons:Very old fashioned. The decor is very old fashioned cubicle like (not too modern, like google, or facebook, etc.). All engineers have to wear business casual while other workers can wear anything (it felt superioristic). My superiors to my boss seemed so political and not engineering oriented. Meetings made every second of every day."
1c5q5f,pros:Had a great career path cons:No longer care about employees
4t1f5s,pros:The flexibility provided when personal situations arise and the opportunities given to explore different jobs inside the company. The salary is very competitive. cons:The telecommuting agreements changes during 2016 limiting the use of it and limited recognitions to employee efforts and the work force reduction done during 2016.
0r2t7b,"pros:Salary is acceptable. Projects I've worked on have been multi-disciplinary, technically challenging, and overall interesting to work on. cons:The leadership is tanking this company. I never knew this level of low morale was even possible. Most attribute it to the insatiable greed of the outgoing CEO. He is trying to ensure his retirement comfort through the furloughs, layoffs, reduction in benefits, salary freezes, etc., that have been going on for years now. The company is doing well, but he is milking every dollar for the bottom line he can with these unsustainable hardships on the employees. I can't imagine there has ever been a company that has cared less about their employees. Also, management cares more about the number of overtime hours you put in, rather than any output of value or quality of work. This contributes to a terrible work culture and general lack of work-life balance."
4g2x6y,"pros:People are great, not management. cons:Pay and benefits are disgusting the worst."

7h5i4k,"pros:The work is exciting. My team, and leadership is great and really care about people. They understand work/life balance and motivate team to go above and beyond to meet goals. cons:However, executive leadership does not care for the employees. Market is down and hard decisions need to be made, however, leadership does not think of the team when making these decisions. They give as little as 2-3 week notice for furloughs and layoffs. When asked about future activities, their response is always the same...""nothing is planned"". However, a month or so later an announcement comes out about another furlough/lay off. It is foolish for executives to believe employees do not know our leaders are looking into the future. They know in advance if actions are needed and yet, they refuse to help their employees by giving as much notice as possible. They don't care. Then to add, a few weeks ago, it was announced no longer remote working was allowed...We just step backed into the 80's. No other fortune 500 company believes in this philosophy. If Honeywell is looking for people to quit to avoid another layoff, they will get it, the problem is their high performing employees will quit and they will be left with what is left."

0k3n6d,"pros:I work with (or worked with before they left) good people. cons:I was hired as a remote worker, and accepted the job based on the work from home policy. The company has recently revoked this policy for all workers for no reason. Many of us work globally via Skype, starting our days at 5am and being highly available for this type of need, so taking away WFH makes zero sense. They have also cut benefits and i have never received a merit raise or bonus, even though i am consistently rated highly by management and peers."
3w2e4o,"pros:Honeywell has pretty good benefits. You will not work weekends, it's Monday through Friday. You will receive an aggressive employee discount within the branch. cons:I've never worked for a company that provides very minimal amount of training. Vendors would rarely come in to train, if they came in it was to meet a ""visit quota"" and leave very shortly after dropping off flyers. If you're new to the security industry this job will be a huge challenge for you. Also, you will take numerous calls a day. There's very minimal branch traffic as ADI provides drop shipping and overnight shipping. It's also team commission, so if you're use to holding your own destiny, you now rely on your team to sell and seek out new business. There's absolutely no way that they could structure commissions on an individual level however due to the size of their customers accounts."

6a8j5p,"pros:The engineers are dedicated and some of the best people I've worked with in the ACS//ISC/Aerospace business. Very smart and overall a pleasure to work with. The 401K match is decent,but only if you put away 7% of your paycheck towards it. Pay is decent, however a good chunk of it is taken up by the ridiculous healthcare costs. cons:The benefits are a joke- the healthcare is astronomically expensive and there's no company match.It takes years before you get any additional vacation time added (5 years until you get an additional week) and you never get additional PTO.The work/ life balance at Honeywell is deplorable and that's attributed to the austerity measures put in by the top brass (CEO - Cote) a couple years ago, plus bad planning all the way down the leadership chain - in all business units. Simply put, if you work here you're just a number; a metric, not a person with a life outside Honeywell. And this company will work you until they either break you or lay you off. There are better and more stable engineering companies out there.Very little development or promotional opportunities unless you're in the senior, upper leadership. I rarely see regular engineers/ managers promoted to the next level in any SBU.Honeywell is a very bloated company. There are metrics and more metrics and so many processes we have to go through to get simple things done (ordering software, refreshing computers, office supplies, etc) that we waste a lot of our time just trying to accomplish basic tasks when we could be doing science."

Good turn around job for a college grad - everyone who doesn't work here will be impressed that you work in such a 'prestigious' company. cons:Oh I couldn't possibly fit all the cons in here. Its a big business. No one cares about you or your ideas. Forget that thought that anything you learned in a degree program will matter to your job. A high school dropout with a few months of training could do your job, There is little to no engineering ever involved. Only when you need to engineer a way to do your actual job without using their broken tools and ancient processes. You will work hard but there will be some excuse why you dont get compensated for it. In fact chances are good you will either get furloughed or laid off. If you dont, you will see good people go and awful rectal-smoochers stay. The company wastes money on silly things like signs and propaganda and is constantly telling employees they are in ""bad/tough times"". Meanwhile executives get multi-million dollar bonuses even in the tough times. They don't even have the decency to accept this openly they will still insult you by pretending they are sacrificing as much as the little guy. This place slowly sucks your joy like a dementor. Other than that, it's probably pretty typical for an engineering company. Oh and forget any growth opportunity. There is none. When someone retires or leaves, they just have others pick up their work with no compensation or promotion."

Did not offer to relocate me when I switched contracts to a site farther away from my residence than the previous site. The company was a little tribal and insular."

Bottom line is it doesn't really matter how good or bad you are at your job just be friends with your supervisor no matter how much you hate them and they will make you look good.Can not take any issues to the HR department nothing will ever be done and they will just gossip to the shop about whatever you tell them.

6t5a5c,"pros:Excellent technology and exciting projects. Cohesive and smart group of engineers and engineering managers. Low turnover. Manufacturing under the same roof. Relatively low stress work environment. Good work-life balance for starting out, decreases as your area of responsibility grows.ISC (factory) has undergone many positive changes with the Honeywell Operating Standards over the past 5 years. Improved efficiency, quality, sense of ownership, and workplace environment.Engineering salaries are very good, respectable annual merit increases (2-3+%), fluctuates with the market conditions as well as with individual contributions. Performance incentives (bonuses) for Principal and Staff Engineers and Management, Band 4 & 5. Respectable 401k match, believed to be 1%/1% to 3%, then 1/2%/1% to 6%.On site cafeteria with food trucks. cons:Honeywell is going through a period of furloughs and layoffs over the last year and a half.Honeywell Aerospace is making adjustments while trying to streamline engineering and manufacturing processes, mostly good, but the one-size-fits-all across all product lines is detrimental to some sites, this one specifically. With a short development cycles (1-3 yrs) additional processes have increased the overall development cycle duration and cost while OEM customers expect decreasing development cycles. Executive management has recognized this and is starting to make changes.The local engineering organization, as great as it is, seems to be unable or unwilling to become excellent. A lack of vigor and/or a sense of complacency seems present.Honeywell Aerospace is a matrix organization with little on-site business presence. The ISC manufacturing support of new programs needs more of a sense of urgency early in development with a comprehensive manufacturing plan with concise objectives. The ISC leader and his management team changes every 1-2 years; it's hard to make sustainable improvements with a revolving door.Grass roots growth for the site is available, but challenging to support within the Honeywell corporate umbrella. Organizational changes on the business side are in process to improve this.Career advancement is given little effort by management, and the measurement of developing skills is ambiguous. Willingness to relocate improves your opportunity to accelerate your career growth. The executive management solution to engineering attrition has primarily been more global engineers, mainly in India. Grim outlook for new graduates in the states with this company.Vacation time starts at 2 weeks, even for experienced employees (5-10 yrs). 3 weeks at 5 years, and I believe 4 weeks at 15 years and caps at 5 weeks at 25 years. Vacation time is non-negotiable for new hires.Aging site with insufficient reinvestment. Dated conference rooms for customer meetings, office area carpet is grungy with lots of duct tape on lifting seams, 15-30 year old cubicles."

No more ability to work from home. Instead, they make us all sit in an awful open floor plan that looks like a prison yard and makes people miserable. Vacation policy for non-exempt employees is weak. The insurance is pretty much the worse I've ever had. Layoffs are common. Morale stinks for a reason. American jobs given to Indians without care or thought. I tell everyone who will listen about this in particular. Honeywell doesn't give a damn about hollowing out the American middle class."

There seems to be no change in sight.The 401k match is very small and you don't get any of your 401k match for the entire year unless you work until Dec 15th. You may want to ask yourself why are they doing this and the answer is because the turnover is so high because the benefits are so low, people stay at jobs here for the least amount of time possible. Also, Corporate gets to make interest on your 401k match money the whole year before they give you a cent! They try to send you an email like this is a positive change for all the employees, which tells you just how little they think of your intelligence and just how much they value you."

They've been saying ""we're working on it"" for over a year now. They have a ridiculous overtime policy, you have to work an extra 5 hours per week for FREE before you even start to earn overtime, then it's just straight pay. Annual raises don't keep up with inflation or medical increases. Even with a promotion you are still slowly loosing money by working here. Last year I only got 2.6 percent. Just got a promotion and it was only 2% increase, but I'm managing nearly 30 projects!We are all overworked too. Many good engineers are leaving and we have to keep taking on extra work loads. Meanwhile they can't get new people in because they wont offer enough to attract anyone good."
0d7k6n,"pros:Perform well, take initiative, continuously improve, communicate effectively, and make positive changes. You will be noticed. cons:Benefits reduced and raises are unsufficient. They can work to improve employee motivation and morale."
8r3y1q,"pros:Work with talented/smart people in a modern facility. Advanced manufacturing technology is incorporated into production. Work/life balance is good. The culture is mostly positive. The salary is competitive. cons:Lots of work, need more people! Promotions can feel slow. Benefits aren't what they used to be. Some policy updates seem to punish retirees. No EV charging available."

8j9i9n,"pros:Great HR team. People are competent, hard working. Great relationships and people really pull together. cons:At the time, leader Carey Smith (an those she brought in) really pulled the organization down into price war bidding in areas not worth fighting for. Business went from very high capacity and spiraled down. Less than half its size now."
5t7c2x,"pros:I got a mediocre paycheck (when we werent on furlough) and, well, I cant think of anything else. They had a decent cafeteria but that was outsourced and run by another company. cons:Management, Waldren specifically, have no interest in the employees. They outsource everything to the lowest bidder which ends up delivering bad products. Little to no raises. Furloughs even though the company was making money. Health benefits get cut back more and more every year. Its cost over everything. They dont want American workers. The moral when I left was terrible with people leaving it wanting to leave."

3z9p4m,pros:Honeywell has some great People. Overall positive experience. I would recommend. cons:Salary was less than competitive.
2n9c4m,pros:Some people are able to move up the chain quickly. For these people the company is great. The company rewards some people for their skills. cons:Some people start and end in the same job. This company doesn't always promote their best talent.
1i6h2n,"pros:Great people make the job rewarding. Opportunities to be promoted from within. cons:Company made 38.6 Billion in 2015, no one got raises. Excessive overtime. Company does more to keep shareholders happy than they do employees. Distribution Centers (Warehouses) increase profit by shipping orders early to customers, even taking shipments out through the following month to increase revenue in the current month. This increases demand on man-hours to make up the lost revenue the following month and then compounds overtime to show false profits."
1t7i0q,pros:Decent pay and close to my residence cons:Pay raises for US employees average once every two years and run at ~2%. Benefits continue to be cut over past several years. Expect long hours and no appreciation. My area moved to open floor plan so there is no longer any personal space.
9v2l3i,pros:Large company. With many opportunities cons:Terrible culture. Which means low morale

1g6w0b,"pros:Good quality of life, interesting work, good people, collegial atmosphere cons:Funding for projects is very hard to come by, especially in the US, even when those projects are stated management priorities. It really feels like management thinks of the employees as liabilities rather than assets."
0x8m7l,"pros:Competitive, fast paced, lots of opportunity to grow. Busy and challenging. Requires constant engagement. Working with cross functional teams across all aspects of the business. cons:Long hours, phone calls in the middle of the night due to simple production upsets that could've been fixed shortly and easily without a phone call waking me up."
3e0b7e,pros:Honeywell Aerospace has a very impressive technical portfolio and a new CEO coming in that has a much needed growth mindset. cons:Honeywell Aerospace has focused on cost and process to the detriment of growth. It also has far too many initiatives stretching it far too lean and leading to poor execution.
1w6g4f,pros:Starting salary might be pretty good cons:Treats employees as necessary evils and costs to be minimized. Annual erosion of benefits. Worst of all is the intellectual property agreement that you probably won't see until the day you actually start work. Extremely one sided with significant restrictions for one and two years after you leave. Agreement also has you give up important legal defense rights. Telecommuting banned last year after a decade of encouraging it.
2b4r4h,"pros:Great people, great work, opportunity to learn. cons:Overtime is always required and uncompensated. Removing benefits regularly, layoffs of great people with over 30 years of experience with the company. No future big picture planning, it is all about how do we get profits today."

Responsibility is to execute what is told, no need to think.3. Development means a process development, mostly dealing with documents.4. poor benefits; employee's portion keeps increasing.5. lack of promotion and recognition. good luck if you want to get inspired.6. no clear career pathIf you just need a simple technical job with a technical background, this is the best place.If you look for a real engineering work, go to somewhere else."
6t2t6b,"pros:Able to maintain work life balance with flexible work hours. Feel a strong sense of job security and room to grow so long as the factory remains in business. cons:Generally, a toxic atmosphere reigns over the south bend plant. The recent lock out grew tensions between salaried and hourly union workers. Leadership seems to hold onto incompetent workers. Deviations in the manufacturing process affect a surprisingly large amount of the product being made.Theres a bi-modal population distribution between entry-level and senior level employees nearing retirement age. It seems most young people come in for ~3 years and run away.They recently debuted unlimited vacation but left approval to your managers descretion. My manager claims to not have resources to allow anyone in the group to take more vacation than they were allotted before this policy. That leaves the newer employees with 2 weeks, and the veterans with 4-6 weeks depending on tenure, so whats the point?"
4i5h1n,"pros:Great benefits, good management, opportunities for growth cons:Sometimes the size can make it challenging to accomplish certain tasks"

4d1d0f,"pros:#NAME? cons:- Honeywell views employees as liabilities. They cut back benefits at every turn. For example, they just announced that 401K match will be given only at the end of Jan of each year (lump sum). You lose it if you retire or are laid off. All this when they "

4y4j1k,pros:Excellent technical products for aerospace/space industry. cons:Stuck in the old military industrial complex methodology of operating. Superb propaganda machine for publicity. Outsources everything (Trump take note). Does not value any employee long or short term unless your one of the targeted 'stars'.
3o4x9y,pros:Ok to work for if you like big business cons:Believe their HR department needs some work.
9q2h5f,"pros:On the whole, people were friendly and the interview process was fairly standard. cons:Multiple reorganizations in the time that I was there, direct management often off-site and not very communicative. Too many people in upper management that don't assist smaller facilities in meeting goals."
0r0v8o,"pros:Company allows for some flexibility in schedule. cons:With the recent work furloughs and layoffs, there is no job security. As a result, the employee morale is low. High deductible medical insurance."
8o9y6a,pros:Aquire good testing experience and have the ability to perform different method of troubleshooting. cons:The cons are that is difficult to increase your salary and promotion. You have to jump to another department to get a promotion.
0u1p4t,pros:work is great and company is good cons:lack opportunities to grow and find better opportunities
3k5f5z,"pros:Gained design experience and friendly coworkers. cons:Layoffs, no raises, furloughs. Best quarterly profit isn't good enough for Wall Street."
5p6e8i,"pros:exciting place to work, very fast pace, lots of change, good people in the trenches. cons:Corporate management only has 30-day patience for results. This trickles down into organization culture. The constant pressure to deliver 90 results for Wall Street results in continuous upper management churn & burn mentality."
7c9e6m,"pros:There are no Pros. They are not deserving of any stars at all. Glassdoor makes your select at least one.... cons:This is by far, the worst company I have ever worked for, period. And not by choice! I was part of a recent acquisition or should I say, I am a victim of a recent acquisition. Honeywell bought us and quickly destroyed our operating model, forced us to transition to their benefit programs (which is literally unaffordable), and downgraded all of our positions. Having worked in my industry for many years - I have worked hard and earned a senior level manager position and now Honeywell tells me I will be ""supervisor"". They preach that they are customer focused and care about their employees, but that is far from the truth. If you are looking for a job with flexibility - YOU WILL NOT GET THAT HERE. They do not allow you to work from home or take vacation. Work/Life balance does not exist. They have moved to an ""unlimited"" vacation program, but this is not because they want salary/exempt employees (non-exempt employees are not eligible for the program) to actually have unlimited vacation. Its because their turnover is so high and they cannot retain people, they needed a way to reduce cost and not payout vacation to employees who quit. Their culture is disgusting. I am honestly sad for anyone who chooses to work here on their own merit. You are clearly desperate for a job. Those of you who are a part of acquisitions, I feel your pain. You are not alone. Unfortunately, they will continue to buy companies, destroy the integrity of that company, and eliminate those employees and move on to the next business. Regardless of an acquisition or not, they are a horrible organization and a despicable place to work. Be warned, stay away."
4g1q5e,"pros:Has many loyal and hard working employees with great teams to work with. Honeywell has always been able to seek out talent. There is a very nice onsite gym which is a great benefit. There is ability to move up within the company if you apply yourself. cons:Multiple Furloughs, Layoffs (RIF's), Reduction in benefits, So much change (recent re-org) in management, Seems to be no loyalty to employees and retain talent/knowledge, very low company morale."

2b4k1w,"pros:Fellow employees are nice. Aside from that there are no pros cons:Management does not care about the employees. mandatory furloughs with one weeks notice. Monthly lay offs. They are out of touch with reality. Benefits are very expensive and go up in cost, an down in coverage every year. I see the day coming where they do not offer any benefitsThe 1 star ratings reflect the fact that zero stars was not an option"
7q4s3c,"pros:Employee development was spot on. Training was fantastic - both hard and soft skills. Strong succession and career planning is provided to high-performers and mid-range employees are empowered and valued in their roles. Excellent working culture among co-workers who are very professional and collaborative. cons:Changes to the Six Sigma program continue to handicap employees who work in process areas. Salaries are not competitive, talent retention struggles"
8u4i4l,"pros:interesting products when there's a chance to improve them cons:limited innovation, limited to a few employees"
7q2o2d,"pros:Peers, employees, support team, and site management were all great to work with. Lots of smart, motivated people with good attitudes who are willing to work together in tough headwinds. cons:In 18 months working at the Redmond site, I was furloughed for three separate 1-week periods without pay and did not receive a raise. This was the case for ALL supervisors, managers, and engineers. Band 4 and up had bonuses cut as well."
1s8i8m,pros:Brand name. No work pressure cons:Unprofessional environment. HR has no authority. Constant turmoil in hierarchy and org level. Not a stable workplace
0e0v5a,pros:They do interesting and meaningful work. The people are great. cons:Not so great benefits (health insurance etc)
2b4f0w,"pros:During the 2008 financial crisis, Honeywell worked very hard to keep everyone. To do this we had to take a week of unpaid vacation. That, I think was a very courageous and caring thing to do. cons:A little heavy with the administrative daily time card tracking and stop work states related to contractual obligations. But unavoidable due to government contract rules"
7s5b0w,"pros:I enjoy working here, I really do. cons:But, isn't forcing me to pay $1500 dollars a year if I don't allow a third party to have access to me or my spouses biometric (medical) test results a HIPPA violation? Not sure how that can be legal. Had I known prior to coming here, it would have impacted my decision."
3d9p9i,"pros:Honeywell has resources all over the world so you can find experts with your topic of interest literally anywhere. cons:Because it is a global organization, Honeywell expects you to work around the clock. They do not hire engineers in North America because they would provide you with resources from countries such as India or China. It saves them money but it's not exactly Agile. After awhile, the long nightly scrum calls really drain you. Integration issues arise too when you count on someone so far away to provide you with software and sometimes they don't have the hardware to do the integration so you end up doing the integration."
5o6r2g,pros:Exciting and challenging work.Employees passionate about their work.Strong executive leadership (during my tenure) cons:Group was still being developed so some misunderstanding about responsibility and role within business units. But that will be worked out as teams become more familiar.
0f1a7d,"pros:Great people. Local management is supportive. Interesting work. cons:""Making the numbers"" seems more important to corporate management than doing what's necessary for long-term growth. This is especially harmful to a sector like Defense and Space that has to think long-term, not the next quarter."

Coworkers, direct supervisor and even the next level up in management are easy to work with and approachable.Diversity of Work: Able to work in many different capacities from design to production support to test. Keeps the day to day varied and fresh. cons:Work/Life Balance: Be prepared to work weekends. Since upper management decided to layoff everyone that wasn't absolutely critical remaining employees are being forced to pick up the slack. Now they are coming back with more layoffs and this is only going to get worse.Benefits: 401K matching is there but not great; 75% up to 8%. The insurance plans are a joke.Morale: Unsurprisingly overworked people that have to deal with multiple layoffs every year don't always bring the best attitudes into the office."

Shifts are reasonable. cons:People are laid off in one breathe and they are celebrating making all of the company goals, including income. People need to do more with less people.

Managers show favoritism and award employee of the year to mediocre performance. NO RAISES FOR AN ENTIRE DIVISION IN 3 YEARS!!! The company will boast how much billions they have made for quarter(Because they are not paying out any raises). No room for growth and advancement. Employees are overworked and underpaid!!!

7e1f2a,"pros:Hard to think positively through the continuous rain of blows to my wallet. cons:Last January I had 25 days of vacation to use when I chose. This year I have zero. If my supervisor feels like rewarding me -and provided the company gives him a budget to pay me - I may be able to get days off. If I need time off for job interviews (and I plan to!), I have none available. Probably I'll get some vacation this year. But since vacation pay is now discretionary spending - the first thing to be cut when money is short, as it ALWAYS is in this company - I expect to be ""rewarded"" less every year, instead of guaranteed more as in our old earned vacation plan.It's really REALLY hard to see this change as anything other than (yet another) huge benefit cut. Essentially the hourly earnings HW owes to me just dropped 10%."

I also have a $1500 deductible before my insurance even pays a thing. Company is not paying for Dental this year :(Work from Home is going away. Yes we used to be a progressive company that trusted employees to get the job done - but now we are regressing back to the 1980's - where if they don't see you in a site - you must not be working.

You will get paid, so you should not complain.Your creativity will be smothered under layers of globally misaligned and counter competitive policies, checklists, and teleconferences.Employee Benefits is a misnomer."
6h4f6p,"pros:Good standard benefit package (401k, Health/Med Plan, Life Insurance, Company matching), great people making part of great teams no matter what position you are in. Employee discounts, great innovative/helpful site management, higher paying than many other engineering opportunities in PR.Flexible work hours, good cafeterias in both PR sites. cons:Good engineers keep waiting to get noticed, promotions in Puerto Rico have become slow, almost halted across many teams even when they are going above and beyond their current roles for less than national average pay in a U.S. territory that just gets more expensive/exclusive. The educational assistance was a catch, in my case. Management made it look as if everyone gets a chance and that you can get started quick after a year with the company, but they have made it impossible for me to obtain approvals to continue studying in related fields (after more than 2 years) and in cases where I have had the opportunity to grow and learn from other design tools I have been slamed with a no for an answer in front of other peers. (Almost makes it feel like they really didn't want me to grow).Many employee discounts for PR are irrelevant or outdated to local stores and discounts available are less than half of those in U.S mainland... worst than that... company products offered to employees at a diacounted price are actually cheaper in Amazon for everyone to buy."
5n1c3i,"pros:It's nice to be employed. Stock is at an all time high. cons:No raises in 2 years. If you get one, it's no more than 2%. 10% pay cuts, bonuses cut by 50% if you are lucky enough to get them. Layoff and furloughs abound. Jobs going to either MX or India.High deductible/high cost medical. Health savings contributions cut in 1/2 last year, discontinued this year. Those who get bonuses have been told they will be cut from 10 to 5%."

1x4n3o,"pros:Autonomy, no micromanagement, smart people. cons:None, none, none, none, none."
5m0d5k,pros:Lots of opportunities and room for career development if you can stomach the politics. Decent benefits but they are continuing to reduce them under the guise of cost savings. cons:Inconsistent direction and constant leadership changes have caused the business unit I was with to falter badly. They have reduced headcount to the absolute minimum and can barely execute to keep the lights on let alone drive change and innovation
2w5u5n,"pros:Interesting work and reasonable Manager. cons:Corporate Benefits, furloughs, changes to policy. Vacation increase after 5 years."
7m2v0g,pros:Good salary from long term employment cons:Constant reduction or removal of all benefits. Unrealistic production schedules. Pessure to maintain schedules. Non value added bureaucracy.

8a7i4p,"pros:Permanent employment, check bi-weekly, & some individual are professional & helpful cons:Low advancement opportunities, company care more about money than employees livelihood. No raises, medical benefits & other perks cut every year, while the CEO, VP & other upper level management salaries continue to increase. Notice of furloughs, & layoff are a constant occurrence."
8v1n8s,pros:Interesting and challenging work. cons:Open office environment is difficult and distracting
2c3f0y,"pros:People and fast paced. I learned a lot, but then trying to get out of the job for over 4 years was impossible. cons:Underpaid! Once I looked outside and went on interviews it was very clear how much I was underpaid even after asking for a raise many times. Medical benefits are horrible."
0i2g4m,pros:Some very good people to work with around the country. cons:Constant knowledge drain throughout the aerospace division due to poor decisions in upper managements desire to globalize.
1k5g0v,pros:Good engineers / mentors for growth cons:Merit raises uncommon / layoffs
5h2y6k,"pros:I honestly can't find a plus for this company. cons:Everyone is overworked and not getting paid for overtime, management kept telling the team the project has no money but requires us to work extra hours. The unlimited vacation is a joke, you get crucified for taking too many days off. There's fear in this new culture that if you are an underperformer you will not have a project to work on and you will be let go. It's also top heavy, too many people managing projects and not enough people doing real work. Management demand is also unrealistic, they push you to deliver the products but won't give you resources or time to complete it. The benefit package (medical, dental, vision) is nothing to brag about, you pay a lot for a family plan although the company is self-insured. There's also no remote work policy."
4d3f8i,"pros:Honeywell has high slaries and huge bonuses if you can make it through the bonus slick criteria cons:Lost all talent. More people leaving than can be hired to stop the bleeding. No accountability, and CSO loses orders and rejects sales for process violations. Process is more important than the customers or sales. Policies change without notifying the stakeholders and roadblocks become mountains. No one follows through, functional groups are not accountable to the business, everything is chaos internally and managment spends 110% of their time putting out fires and cannot fix systemic issues."
9j1s8n,pros:Decent pay and vacation time cons:No perks such as Christmas parties or retirement gifts etc
4f8f0h,"pros:so slow moving that it can be confused with a government agency, so VERY STABLE job, job security is high. cons:hard to advance a career, very top heavy, way too many managers and meetings, very little people to do the work. The resources that are available are in China or India. Doesn't hire engineers stateside, all outsourced around the world."
3m9d8o,pros:Competitive salaries and good benefits cons:Poor salaries and good benefits
8q9j8t,"pros:Project teams include fantastic individual contributors. cons:Management seems to advocate ""bullying"" by superiors.Benefits are substandard - healthcare is really expensive and basically only convers major medical.Management does not allow remote working so there is NO flexibility.Forced to take a 2 week furlough (unpaid time off) in 2017."

1h9h4d,pros:Strong tradition of excellence throughout organizations cons:Delays exists in data flow down as with any large and decentralized operations
7y5p4b,"pros:Somewhat Competitive Pay, flexible scheduling cons:Regardless of work ethic, there is a strong sense of exclusion if you aren't ""friends"" with the right people. I felt under-valued, under-appreciated, not trusted, under-involved and under challenged. I was let go because of budget cuts and I know a lot of hands were tied through that decision, but corporate doesn't have a clue about what is happening in Wichita and could care less about how it effects anyone there."
9g6r3m,"pros:Pay - the golden handcuffs are hard to ignore cons:Work life balance, unrealistic demands, took too long to hire to replace"
0o5i8h,"pros:Higher than average salaries with bonus potential. cons:Honeywell is constantly downsizing, so workload was always increasing without compensating for extra time. The stress of the constant rounds of furloughs and layoffs was demotivating, coupled with Honeywell's consistent poor performance in customer surveys when compared to competitors."
1v7u0w,"pros:At least you have a job. The company must be doing things somewhere, because the CEO is being richly rewarded and they were always talking a lot of good things happening in the future at the same time management was saying there was no pay increase. cons:Continually being negatively motivated by being told at least you have a job. This little phrase was sprinkled around repeatedly. Especially at salary review time, but not so much when talking about corporate profits or the bonus being given the CEO.Leadership was sorely lacking at the site and there seemed to be no big picture plan. When management was told by professionals that managers were not listening, an additional dozen or so managers were hired from internal personnel. Actually most of the people who weren't listening were promoted. Don't even attempt to try to tell your immediate supervisor, much less management, that they might be doing something wrong or incorrectly, and that there might be a better way to get things done. Big on 'people are our most important asset', but a lot of lip service and little action. To contrast, there were people being treated rather well. Must be some method to the madness. The culture seemed strange at this location in promoting managers who were not getting the job done. Expect to be like any other company - management wants you to do everything and help them to continually improve - constantly preaching change and yet fighting it every step of the way to eventual contract loss."
5n3l9n,pros:Standardized Procedures and overall activities cons:Better benefits and train better the recruited employees before executing delegated tasks.
2u7b9z,pros:The people are great to work with. cons:Aerospace business is losing benefits

8u6a5f,pros:Large corporation with a procedure for everything. Support services are above par. cons:Impersonal treatment from upper management. CEO has expressly stated that work/life issues are not a priority. Expensive insurance. Upper management has problems prioritizing and controlling large projects as they refuse to listen to engineers with decades of non-Honeywell experience.
3d5q7f,pros:Good learning and interesting product. cons:Corporate decisions impacting morale.

9t1t5r,"pros:Been at Honeywell/AlliedSignal/Garret/AiResearch for almost 40 years. I've been privileged to work with some of the brightest, most talented people I've ever met. The work is very challenging, which tends to bring out the best in us. The culture is collaborative, and the projects are team oriented, and all are encouraged to bring the best they have to the job. Compensation is performance based. There is opportunity for growth and advancement, created by the development of new products, as well as attrition due to age demographics. New management at the top is extremely growth oriented and supports bold initiative and new ideas. cons:Ongoing benefits erosion, arguably, or not, consistent with the rest of the industry."

7a8r5q,pros:it's need you had ability to manager yourself cons:always feel waste time to work in it.
8b8v0y,"pros:Honeywell does a great job of acquiring other companies. cons:The company I worked for in WA state was acquired by Honeywell in 2013. The division of Honeywell that I worked in does a poor job of making employees feel like they are valued contributors, and the division was hemorrhaging good people every month. Benefits are low compared to other major employers in the area (BA, MSFT, Google, etc.). Some people have received no salary increases for the last two years."
7y4m1f,"pros:Its been almost an year since I started working here. One of the best pros is salary. Honeywell pays way above then the market rate for employees working in Honeywell - Atlanta Software Centre. cons:Although the pay is very good, so is the work pressure. Also, since this is the new facility, this place has not been organized well. Some of the mid-senior folks get paid almost same as the entry level employees."
5b6c0k,pros:World-class training. Flexible work schedule. cons:Upper management changes every 2 to 3 years causing a lack of focus and consistency in the workplace.Company runs too lean to be effective.Working in the Fortune 100 can be challenging.
4b5h5q,"pros:Challenging, stable, we'll compensated, aerospace management cons:Political, top driven, middle management,"
2e4c7g,pros:The old Intermec people were great prior to being acquired By HSM. cons:After being acquired by HSM the culture completely changed. Management openly said they do not care if people leave...get on the bus or get off is something that was said often.
5e2f8g,"pros:Don't work here.Invest in this company because they only care about the bottom line. cons:No healthcare options.They give you two ""choices"" with the same exact costs and coverage??? The costs are insane to the employee. They pay no part of dental, so you get to pay for all the insurance yourself. There seems to be no change in sight.The 401k match is very small and you don't get any of your 401k match for the entire year unless you work until Dec 15th. You may want to ask yourself why are they doing this and the answer is because the turnover is so high because the benefits are so low, people stay at jobs here for the least amount of time possible. Also, Corporate gets to make interest on your 401k match money the whole year before they give you a cent! They try to send you an email like this is a positive change for all the employees, which tells you just how little they think of your intelligence and just how much they value you."
2t2h9h,"pros:Great People, great team building process. Very consistent and honest about job requirements with help offered. cons:Too many force reductions causing stress with employees."
8c9f2s,"pros:It's a paycheck. But let the reader understand, it is a continuosly shrinking one. cons:Constant threat of layoffs and unpaid furloughs, no cost of living increases nor raises for a couple years running, poor benefits and getting worse, reduced 401K match, expensive insurance ($8000.00 annual deductible for a small family), outsourcing engineering & tech roles to India, micro management, low morale, nearly zero advancement opportunities (the best jobs are being eliminated), and yes there is much more... If there were glory days, they are long gone (unless you're a top dog, then you are laughing all the way to the bank)."

7o8b5u,"pros:Big company with room for growth. Competitive wages. 401k matching. Flexible schedules. This is minor, but unlimited soda and coffee in the cafeteria is a nice little perk. cons:Unstable in Golden Valley with jobs moving out of country. With hiring freezes, no raises in 2016, riffs, and layoffs, it is difficult right now. This is not how it has always been. There have been a lot of changes in upper management that have caused this. Top talent that have been with the company are leaving or being let go."
6b1m5p,"pros:401K matching but that will probably go next since that is pretty much all that is left. cons:No working from home anymore, even for workers that were full time remote but you must drive in to some random office. It's CONTINUOUS lay offs, pay cuts, no raises, benefit cuts... I mean continuous!! Now we have ""unlimited"" vacation meaning you are entitled to NONE and encouraged to log all of your unpaid OT. It's a contest of who can spend the most hours in the office with no vacation or flexibility and only the winners will end up with a job. The health insurance is very expensive with no HSA contribution and no dental."

9n5b3n,"pros:Many great, intelligent people work here. Most people are helpful, and really want to do great work. Very strong engineering and scientific staff are developing some really innovative products.. cons:The overarching focus on cost cutting has reduced resources necessary to do quality work.

3a2e2g,pros:Great pay and work environment cons:I don't have any cons at this time
1z3s1v,pros:Good pay and good team. Thats about it. cons:Terrible work life balance. Micro-managing. Horrible benefits. They will be lucky if the same planners are around in a year. Extremely short staffed even though we are considered fully staffed. Everyone is unhappy. Honeywell is known around Phoenix to work their employees to death from talking to people at other companies.

3y4m3f,"pros:They do some pretty amazing things here at FM&T! Interesting mission if you can internally reconcile its morality. Engineers are among the best anywhere. cons:CEO Dave Cote served his apprenticeship under former GE Jack Welch in the late 1990s - 2000 and brought that baggage with him. Can't deny the success of the business, but much of it comes at the expense of shareholder-employee balance. High deductible health insurance plan - $3000 individual / $8000 family for well-compensated exempt non-union employees. ""Rank and yank"" forced distribution performance review system with rumored 9% annual quota in the bottom blocks (6, 8, 9). Expect to be one of the masses in block 5 and commensurate 2.8% annual raises. Expectations are highly variable among departments."
0f7a7m,pros:Great coworkers - Program teams try to work together cons:Too much focus on metrics and driving the gain for shareholders
6n5d5h,"pros:Honeywell makes a wide range of significant components for everything that flies. The technical challenges can be very interesting and some of Honeywell's solutions are unique and successful. cons:Recent executive changes foretell major strategic changes in many of the company's product lines. The company has 25,000 engineers, scientists, and technicians, 60% of whom don't write software. It's unlikely that a company that constantly reminds it's employees that it is a software company is going to keep those smart engineers much longer. Technical expertise is no longer valued by the top three-four layers of good old boy executives. The technical career path exists on paper. No one knows what the requirements are to climb the last two-three steps."

3p1h0z,pros:Honeywell hires a quality staff and there are a lot of off site benefits working with Honeywell. cons:The current aerospace climate has created a lot of unsteady work for the employees. There have been a few furloughs followed by lay offs and restructuring . This leaves the weight of work on good people who are unable to leave for various reasons.
5r3l7b,"pros:Modern workplace, great treatment of employees and you get to work with some truly brilliant people. cons:Very fast paced and demanding, not right for all people."
0r2x9k,"pros:Decent pay, fair benefits, clear goals. The new direction towards a ""software"" oriented company seems to be maintaining the brand value. cons:The company appears to be preparing to divest some of the business units, although that has not been officially announced. In the interim there is a leadership vacuum that has been filled with various directors, VP's, analysts and other highly compensated individuals lacking experience and business acumen that are micro-managing the workforce out the door."

4z1p1a,pros:The job is there is you want it. You will learn a lot while you are employed with Honeywell. cons:Dont expect to be paid what you are worth. Honeywell is consistently going through organizational transformation and chews through its general management/leadership. Very little employee recognition happens here.

6e4z7z,"pros:Exciting and new challenges, constantly. Very demanding work that had an impact on the companiesbusiness. work was recognized buy superiors and rewarded accordingly. cons:That particular business was sold to an off-shore holding company, and the lab. was disbanded."
1r6f7v,"pros:I've never had a ""corporate"" job before so I was worried that I wouldn't assimilate, but thanks to some great people, supportive managers & some fun projects I can safely say I made the right decision. Those things aside there are a number of other things that make me happy with my move: lateral/upward mobility is one - the company thrives on moving talent across business units; allowing employees to stay engaged and interested. Location is another, the Morris Plains location is beautiful and really makes coming to work everyday easy. Also, upper management gets it, they seem to be making the right moves to pull in & keep talent and to move the company in the right direction. cons:Honeywell is still growing out of ""old"" corporate culture. There are times when you're working on something that should seemingly be easy, but you're hit with a roadblock that may take longer than you may be used to due to un-necessarily complex processes and/or a long approval chain. That seems to be heading the way of the dinosaur though - in my brief time here so far, it's already gotten better."
2w5l2p,"pros:Great people, fun products. Great company for high performers. cons:Executive management has no clue what they are doing. 3 restructures in 2 years and they keep on squeezing everyone to do more work with less."

You will have clear guidance on business expected behaviors and policies. Honeywell is completely invested in employees safety, security, health and well being, and provides all kinds of tools and services towards this goal. cons:They use a lot of outsourcing. This gives you the feeling that your job is never secure. Processes are always changing, sometimes just for the sake of change. The majority of the time there won't be a heads up on this changes. You have to be on your toes."
9m6n7f,"pros:Global company with lots of brand awareness. Good compensation. cons:Hard to navigate thru the Honeywell beast... and it's all about leadership making their big bonuses at the end of the day. It's pretty clear they don't care about their employees but at least they are honest, they don't pretend or sugar coat anything."
6u1s3h,"pros:Great people in their engineering organization, engaging work, and lots of retiring management (i.e. opportunity for advancement). The emphasis on ethical behavior seems to be genuine too. cons:Benefits have been gutted over the last 5-10 years, and they are no longer competitive."

5v3d0o,"pros:Low Emotional Mental and Intellectual Energy Company.They are good at being super cheap. They manage to the order of 20 cents. Great company for cheap employees working in a cheap environment.They try to indirectly force employees from different facilities against each other. Great place to learn how to be a TOXIC LEADER and TOXIC MANAGER. It will teach you the dark arts of creating a toxic environment. Great place to develop neither EFFICIENCY NOR CREATIVITY. I am making this place my scientific project to determine what this environment breeds.No growth but a good place to warm your chair for 10+ years in one position and then hop to the adjacent cubicle for another 10+ years if you are that type with no ambitions.They have outsourced their relocation services to cheap companies like SIRVA which handles the supposedly difficult conversations since Honeywell's advice to them is to discourage by every means necessary to provide any benefits to the employee.You will learn to be a SLAVE in this Company by the time they are done with you. You will seek neither COIN, FAME, POSITION, SUCCESS OR POWER in this firm but end up losing it after selling your rights and privileges. In the end, you can look at your reflection and gleam at the HOPELESS CREATURE that you have become!Mark my words!They have one thing Right. That is the work life balance and FLEXTIME! I will praise Honeywell with no Honey in its well for this privilege. cons:1) Facilities are old, worn and broken.2) Building are actually trailers. It is a trailer park in the Phoenix facility.3) Harmful and toxic emissions that are inhaled in this facility. Management simply avoids the topic and avoids cleaning up the junk.4) Employees are given desks and chairs that are over 30 years old. They are broken and quite some of them got hurt.5) Management does a scavenger hunt around the junkyard, dumpsters and trash collection points to find cables, cords, chairs, desks, materials etc.6) Even Senior managers are placed in cubicles and expected to share it with other team members in some occasions. Even they use dumpster chairs.7) The building is packed like sardines.8) Facilities need serious attention and overhaul. Most of them don't even meet the fire code and building safety codes. It looks like old mud hills from the 1960s9) There is barely any young person in this facility who retain their position for more than 6 months.10) The senior professionals with over 27 years of service are simply waiting anxiously to get their pension and 401(k).11) Most managers due to depression have a lackluster performance because they are asked to manage with a shoestring budget.12) They are audited for buying paper, pen, paper clips, power cords and anything over $20.13) I think the Company is politely telling everyone to leave the facility so that they can covertly discourage libels, lawsuits and severance pay for many of these professionals.14) Zero accountability from Senior Leadership. I mean absolute ZERO besides empty speeches and hollow promises that are expected to deliver no outcome. They rarely visit the plant, facilities to determine the health, safety and environment of the employees.15) All the neighboring industrial zones have been marked for restoration. In fact all the neighboring industries have had their buildings demolished.16) Going to work is an absolutely DEMORALIZING and UNHEALTHY EXPERIENCE."

You will need it to decompress from the daily routine and political nonsense. If you aer young, looks good on resume but don't plan on a rewarding career here anymore cons:Very difficult place to work due to highly political environment. Also very restrictive work practices and weak efforts towards communication. No value for subject matter experts and higher value for developing regions over developed regions that built the businesses. Will lose lots of expertise in next few years that simply can't be replaced (aging workforce that can't wait to get out). Stagnant wages, below average benefits (and getting worse) and a customer base that hates doing business with us. This is a highly competitive matrixed environment that promotes lack of trust between employees and little to no collaboration. It is a culture of just cooperation that looks like teamwork but is really limited where withholding knowledge is often a source of power and influence. Constant leadership changes that slow program progress. Seem to value hatchet men that cut more than visionaries for long-term growth and health of the businesses"

I am on my second week, and from the IT department to the payroll support and of course the great manager I have this has been a great experience so far. The company expects high performance and people who are focused on profitability, but that is why they are successful. cons:I came from a much smaller company and it was a bit overwhelming to be in a large company where they have detailed processes and telephone hotlines for everything.

If you are able to stay under the radar and put up with average pay and reduced benefits, you could camp out here for many years. cons:Large slow moving company. If you live in China or India you will be very happy here. Otherwise, look for no raises, reduced benefits and managers that move around every few years changing the policies of the former managers. They just cut more benefits for US workers for the 2017 year. My favorite quote in business applies here: ""A company should be concerned when their most passionate workers go silent"".

Deviations in the manufacturing process affect a surprisingly large amount of the product being made.Theres a bi-modal population distribution between entry-level and senior level employees nearing retirement age. It seems most young people come in for ~3 years and run away.They recently debuted unlimited vacation but left approval to your managers descretion. My manager claims to not have resources to allow anyone in the group to take more vacation than they were allotted before this policy. That leaves the newer employees with 2 weeks, and the veterans with 4-6 weeks depending on tenure, so whats the point?"

5u1g1y,"pros:Flexible hours although that may changeI work with great people and my local managers are excellentCelebrity CEO recently retiredDecent pay although most likely below market rates if you stay there for too long cons:Unlimited vacation policy started this year, it is not unlimited and most employees will probably not get approved (yes you need to be approved for all vacation even though it's unlimited) for as much as they used to be entitled to. Medical costs have skyrocketed faster than the industry. No dental. 401k match permanently reduced to 75% of what it used to be. Bonuses permanently reduced to 50% of what they were and will most likely be eliminated in the next few years. Basically all benefits have been drastically cut. Multiple furlough each year with little advanced notice. Layoffs multiple times in the last year and now not enough people to complete the work. My 55 hour weeks went to 60+ due to reduction in force and programs have been put off or cancelled. No more remote working makes it difficult to work long hours and many of the best engineers are leaving due to the change. Its also caused severe over-crowding in outdated facilities. No career advancement opportunities, In my 10+ years I only saw one promotion and it was from engineer 1 to 2. Little to no merit increases (even with great performance reviews) and investment. Lots of red tape due to top leadership micromanaging every division. Going back to school was discouraged and no time with the amount of extra hours required to complete projects on reduced schedules. Former CEO bled the employees dry to make Wall Street happy and it will have severe consequences over the next 5 to 10 years. Every reason I started working for Honeywell has been taken away and I no longer see it as a company I plan to retire from, there are just too many better opportunities."

Everyone is very communicative, and conversation is good so far. The internal web portals are very well organized, and getting settled in has been a breeze.Honeywell so far has come across as a company that really wants to make an investment in their employees, allowing them to grow in their profession. cons:If you are going into software looking for a fancy skyscraper office looking out over a city, this isn't exactly it. You will probably get your standard cubicle, although the equipment provided is pretty nice.Honeywell is a bit more of an older company, and they are heavy in government contract work. While it seems that many of their new policies are pretty progressive, their seems to be a fair amount of cookie cutter government paperwork / red tape / corporate kind of activity that goes on (such as redundant or unnecessarily extensive training videos, or lots of digging to get access to materials / information to move forward with projects)."
9f3k4u,"pros:The employees are very friendly, and the work environment is very casual. They have employee functions after normal working hours, so everyone gets to know fellow employees outside the normal work environment. cons:The manufacturing supervisors are very stern and require very specific goals from each employee.

3z3q1g,"pros:Work/life balance that enables increased output and loyalty.Extremely important mission critical to national security.Brilliant and caring people who do what is right, not what is easy. cons:Benefits have been trending negatively due to stock valuation tendencies and an overall cash heavy strategy.

There are many projects that are ongoing so jump on board and give your ideas to the company to make the company and its people better. cons:Sometimes it seems that there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians.
6e8d2p,"pros:Work life balance. Flex schedule. cons:Declining benefits year over year, EVERY year. No 401K match per pay period, now annual lump sum in January, if and if you are employed on Dec 15th. So RIF's will now be commonplace the beginning of December & no benefit of compounding gains throughout the year. Pay is low versus peers for technicians.

Technicians have no path to move up and only 2 promotion possibilities throughout career."

After all, you're just a tool. cons:You're just a tool management wishes to exploit for as long as you're willing to bow your head.No interest in solving the pressing engineering problems. You're expected to stick to ""established methods"" and agree with everything management goes with. You will be managed and led by some of the most incompetent engineers in the field, don't make the mistake of knowing too much science. That's frowned upon and you'll be targeted and your life made a living hell.The more effort you put in your work, the more devalued your time is. Political acumen will go a long way in this company. If you plan to be in engineering for a long time, don't work here for over a couple years.On the other hand, if you have aspirations for running for office or being a politician, this is a great place to work with an environment to help nurture a lot of the backstabbing sabotaging strategies and techniques needed for a successful political career.Many of the people in charge in the firm are not the managers but an elite group of clandestine members of a religious cult who seek to preserve people like them and rid the place of outsiders like you.

Micro-managing is the name of the game and they can't make things worse, they look somewhere else. For example, my department has a ten-fold increase in rework and scrap. Management hides these results in the numbers so they can give themselves a pat on the back. The waste management creates is a laughable fiasco. Lean, Just in time, HOS, are all systems to create the illusion that management uses to justify their own miserable worthless existence. Their gain is the employee's pain. I retired early to rid myself of the depressing selfish charlatans that run this corporation. This isn't Honeywell, this is Allied Signal. They bought Honeywell and took the name because it WAS a much better name. though not anymore. No amount of money is worth putting up with the torment of working and the management team lead by David (Kotex) Cote."

Hired a lot of sales people but furloughed or encouraged others to retire. Remote working is discouraged now even if your work could be done from home solely. PTO is barely there. Moral is low. Transparency on decisions from management is not good. Many mid level managers do not even know what the higher ups are planning. Younger generations want to jump ship or are encouraged to leave by older generations. Minimal advancement. Advancement and pay increase comes with length of time being there mostly."

Vacation time 2 weeks at start, only 2 days sick time, 401 k, If your in with leads you can spend your whole day texting and walking around doing nothing. If you have a health issue you can move to another area, get more money and move up even if you don't have issues for some people. cons:no pension for a fortune 500 company, mandatory overtime and people are in unsafe environment daily, no weekend compensation anymore only 2 days Sat and Sunday, The salaries listed on this site don't include Washington. Washington is about 5$ under paid on most positions. People there are more than 10 years are paid less than the new one hired now. Only 1 break for a 12 hour shift standing on your feet all day and watch other people do nothing. We had 3 1/2 breaks before but they took it away, sick time taken away and now you have to use your 2 days or lose it. medical benefits have $3,000 deductible, safety project never get finished but overlooked. No Christmas parties, no holiday bonus or turkey,"

New 401k Matching contribution changed. Now instead of getting the match with every paycheck you ONLY get it on Jan 31 of the following year. You need to be employed at HON on Dec 15 to be eligible. Thus, if you get RIF'd or quit on Dec. 1 (or anytime before that) you will NOT get the matching contribution.Regarding the unlimited vacation policy. Again, if you get RIF'd or leave on your own there is no 'unused vacation' paid.

7n9m8j,"pros:Sorry to say that I am not able to give any good reason for anyone to work at Honeywell. cons:The shareholders & CEO do not seem to care about their employees at all. They have squeezed as much as they can out of their employees. Their benefits package is basically you paying ridicules prices major medical with a 6,000 deductible. They are constantly having layoffs and furloughs as well as many years with no cost of living / merit increase. All of this coming from a company who's net profits for 2015 was around 41, billion dollars. The CEO and shareholders still get millions in bonuses. This company could care less about their employees and they have become the Walmart of electronics with a check the box mentality. I would not advise anyone to go to work for Honeywell. That is coming from a 6 plus year employee."

2q0j5i,pros:Large diverse company provides a lot of opportunities to get varied experience across multiple product types and industries. cons:Upper/executive management is clueless in regards to what's important to employees and often delivers tone deaf messages and mandates to the working staff. Employees feel unvalued due to recent losses in flexibility and benefits; we're just head count.The atmosphere has recently become very high-pressure as expectations to increase quickly top line growth are hampered by excessive processes as well as an inherently slow industry such as Aerospace.
4g2x7l,"pros:Less likely to be outsourced due to the classification of the contracts. cons:Management thinks employees are complete idiots, trying to tell us ""to improve employee loyality"" while making a cash grab from the employees by holding all the 401K matches until next year. They even told us in January they needed cash, so they took it from the only people they could, the employees."

Opportunities for advancement are plenty. cons:Management is slow and seems to undervalue it's employees. I've seen a lot of engineers leave in my time, and I've heard of many not being properly evaluated. Pay needs to be on par with aerospace industry, not just standard for Honeywell."

0b0r0l,pros:Competitive salary for the market. cons:Not a lot of benefits. Medical insurance is below of what other companies in the areas are offering. Expectation to work above the 40hrs and make up for time spent on non work related activities (yield)
4c9y6w,"pros:The Aerospace product lines are high impact and wide-reaching, so the work can be rewarding. Benefits are decent for vested employees, but not great. My advice: get your start here to gain experience in the field, but don't stay longer than 5 years. cons:While the stock prices rise, and the CEO rakes in over $20M, Honeywell Aerospace employees did not receive raises in 2016. Further, nearly all non-manufacturing employees had to take 2 weeks of unpaid furlough so far this year (we expect to be asked to take another by the end of the year). There have also been 2 rounds of layoffs this year with another round coming in November. The icing on the cake is the new Aerospace Remote Working policy that basically eliminates that option for nearly all Aerospace employees. The ability to work remote at least part of the week in an area that suffers from extreme traffic congestion was a huge perk that is now being revoked. It is the last straw for many of my colleagues. While many other companies are ditching the traditional 40 hour work week at the office in favor of more flexible schedules and telecommuting options, Honeywell once again proves just how out of touch it is with technology and todays workforce. How does the company expect to attract and retain top talent with such outdated, old school thinking? Its a shame because the products people work on in Aerospace are pretty cool, but that cool factor only goes so far."
3d0u1h,"pros:Honeywell offers fair pay, good work experience, decent benefits, typical vacations, and holidays off. You can learn much there. It's a good place to get work experience. cons:I worked in Supply Chain Management at HON's Tempe, AZ site. High stress. No matter how much you do, it's never enough. We abused suppliers, squeezed every dime from them. Management makes unreasonable demands is if they're not met, the employee career is threatened. This is a metrics driven company. Employees are under constant fear of layoff (typically around the Holidays every year). It's a terrible, stressful environment. You've been warned."

Honeywell is also extremely frugal, so any company-paid events, lunches, etc are few and far between."
5s8m7h,pros:Work from home. Nice ppl that you work with. But not many. Many r very old school and stuck in their ways. cons:Pay is low. Super long hours. Expect to work weekends. Cash is king. Folks r very stagnant and very set. No need to improve what they're doing. Very little automation.

7b0n2g,"pros:Our end customer, mission, national security pride on working for DoD project. The dedication and passion from the employees. cons:metrics driven management, you have to work a minimum of 44 hours a week to stay off the layoffs and furloughs(only get paid for 40, rest if free for Honeywell to profit from), you are expected to train yourself and on your own time and money, low morale at all levels, employees are viewed as liabilities not assets, benefits are below par(high deductible, high premium insurance), unlimited vacation (as long as you don't use more than 2 weeks), an average pay raise of -2.5% per year after inflation for the last 10 years, not enough people to support all the processes and red tape, quality is horrible, and managers only care about the checkmark that will ensure they get their bonuses. I could go on and on, but I'm sure you can understand a 1 star rating."

3a4a9k,pros:You will gain experience. You will work so much over time you will double your salary. It is better than being on unemployment. cons:You will be worked like a dog. No one will appreciate that you are working like a dog. You will have to guilt them in to a raise of your base pay. Which you will need to do when you find out that the new hires you are training are making more than you. Though they offer paternity leave dont expect to use it they will fire you before your baby is due. And when I say before I mean three days before.
5u0l9e,pros:I loved working with my customers and co-workers. My co-workers were always very professional. Pay was good. Until about 2006 the benefits were great. cons:Frustrations with management. Changes in my immediate manager and director occurred on an almost yearly basis. The training programs provided did not always pertain to what was need to do the job.
1m2h1w,"pros:Trying hard to come up with a pro; salary is good and 401k is ok. Used to be a good company but unfortunately there isn't much more to say. cons:Constant worry about layoffs; unpaid furloughs; very costly insurance benefits; no raises or bonuses; backwards thinking management; no dental; no acrued vacation, only 56 hours a year pto no matter how long you are here; no WFH allowed; zero loyalty to employees. HR sucks. No pension. CEO is completely out of touch- climate of fear and depression contributes constantly to extreme low morale in the work environment.I see recent 4 and 5 star reviews and, well, they are made up. No one that actually works right now for Honeywell would or could give a good review."

8k7l1i,"pros:I've been here at Honeywell before it was Honeywell. We used to be Fire-Lite / Notifier by Pittway. So its safe to say I've been here for more then 15 years. I love my job, I've had the great luck of getting awesome managers as I climbed the latter. Most of the people I worked with have been great team players. I take pride that this job we do help save lives. We have a great personal relationship with our customers & I believe that has helped our end of the business continue to be successful. cons:Working for Honeywell has been like going to war, you hate the war and you want to leave but you feel that you're doing a job that's meaningful and you don't want to leave your men behind, you feel needed, so you stay in the fight. Leaning practices have given the place a feeling of gloom & doom. Many have left on their own, some have been laid off. In general the whole US workplace have become unsecure, I don't believe anyone has a secured job anymore and that holds very true here as well."
3l4e8v,"pros:Very nice place. Beautiful office, collegial coworkers and very interesting projects. Well run and professional. Proud to be on the Honeywell team. cons:Onboarding is non existent. Benefits are horribly expensive for such a large co. No remote working policy is very last century and restrictive. Not risk takers."
3c7v0k,"pros:Friendly employees, everyone I have interacted with has been very kind and willing to help if they have the time to. cons:There wasn't really an introduction to the company, just more of a quick start, somewhat of a sink or swim situation. However, that description makes it sound more harsh than it was."
5k3n6o,"pros:Competitive compensation, opportunities to learn cons:Micromanagement, so risk adverse there are 10 levels of approval then they wonder why you can't hit deadlines. Over the past 2-3 years SPS has endured RIF's, hiring freezes, furloughs, no merits - keeping commitments to shareholders on the backs of its employees. Eroding benefits."
5q2m8v,"pros:In general, the people are great. My hours are flexible which is important to me. cons:Lots of them. Morale is very low and getting lower for those in the lower ranks. I've been at Honeywell just over a year and am facing my fourth unpaid furlough. Didn't get the raise I was promised at 6 months because wages have been frozen. No overtime, even though work loads are heavy. They keep cutting benefits and the health benefits suck. Constant layoffs. Employees no longer have the option to work remotely. The culture is negative and very vertical. I'm looking for another job!"
8x6e9e,pros:I've only been there a couple months. People are great. Company seems to empower it's employees. cons:The healthcare benefits could be better.
3r8j9g,"pros:Honeywell has been flexible as far as working from home or doing flex hours. Some people come in from 5-1 or 6-2 or 9-5, it's really up to each person what hours they want to work. cons:Furloughs, layoffs, low pay, slow upward movement. The management doesn't care at all about their employees. The CEO is retiring and is trying to artificially inflate the stock price before he cashes out."

9a4k8t,"pros:I like what I work on and most of the people I work with. cons:I've been here for 10 years and have seen the benefits deteriorate almost to nothing. This is a lesson to the youngsters to demand things that they may not be aware of. This is what I had when I started: 1) paid OT (true, after 44hrs and straight time), 2) 401k match at 8%, 3) pension plan, 4) Christmas parties with FREE gifts for all the kids, 5) company picnics, 6), company paid VSP (vision plan), 7) company paid for 1/2 of dental insurance and decent insurance. Now: no paid OT for exempt employees (most engineers), 401k match down to 6% (back from 3%), no pension plan for new employees, forget Christmas parties and picnics. You get to pay for your own vision AND dental plan, have HIGH deductible insurance plan that Honeywell ""blames"" Obamacare for."

8x1n3o,"pros:Interesting products with diverse offerings cons:Honeywell was a great company, but has decided that they do not need people. Over the last few years they have continued to outsource all areas and have such a lean organization that there is no fail safe for critical processes. If you are offered a job, make sure you get a very high starting salary-raises are few and far between. Great place to gain some experience and move to better company."

7n6t7c,"pros:Stock growth. There is not much more to say but even that is tanking. cons:So much to say here. Honeywell wants to become a first class software company. Having worked for a couple of Silicon Valley startups, Honeywell is out of their league. They need to hire a leader who understands agility in order to be competitive in the future. The inability to make decisions, along with their complete disrespect for employees shows to me that Honeywell is destined to continue to fail. Lack of innovation outside of aviation is disheartening. Peeling back benefits, the move to an annual 401K match <-- big deal to us! Honeywell has basically taken money out of our retirement plans and disguised it as ""a way to reward employees"" is essentially a way to rape us of our benefits. We all know they will do their RIF's in December. So, we not only lose those gains over the course of the year - we lose the entire match on Honeywell's whim.I left my Silicon Valley startup to try and help HON grow, man I've tried but it's a lost cause. Everyone on my team is looking for new opportunities outside of Honeywell, as am I. I'm done."

Honeywell took over what was Allied signal, previously Garret Air Research and muck it up then sent a portion of it to Mexico when it became popular for big corps to do so back in 2008.

0j9c6g,"pros:Learned a lot, exposed to new ideas and people. cons:Raises are a joke, benefits are nonexistent, Less than zero support from corporate. Dead end if you don't have a four year degree because any management position requires one. Most sites are treated like a country club instead of a production facility and the only way to get fired is to rock the boat. Many long term employees are only staying for their pensions that are no longer offered for new employees. Salaries are not competitive in the area, the majority of interviews I had before finding new employment were offering 15 to 40% higher wages for similar or less responsibility."
1w4k6v,"pros:Challenging work and nice people cons:Upper management is as crooked as a politician. They take away benefits at every opportunity and when they're shamed into doing something remotely positive, they find a way to make everyone feel worse. Now our 401k match is credited only if you stay with the company through December. Otherwise no match."

Excessive over time, health insurance very expensive, Hon gets involved with medical decisions as they are self insured. We have to agree to getting healthier year over year or we get a surcharge to deductible, they never say thanks, tell you how to make presentations, no given format for weekly/monthly reports so it's a vibrant churn to get it right for today."

2t4v1x,pros:Its a job and pays the bills. cons:Last year 2016 we had 3 Furloungs. Some managers are just not right for the position. HR repesentative for ISC is not the appropiate person for the job

2a0e8p,"pros:Still a few good people left from before HON was purchased by Allied Signal who actually have a heart and care about co-workers. That said, they are retiring at a fast clip. cons:Little to no organic growth; that said profits increase year after year by cost cutting, primarily through employees through layoffs, furloughs, no raises, benefit cuts and not replacing those who leave. The approach appears to be to 'cut their way to greatness'."
7k4z0k,pros:If you are friends with the supervisors they will lie for you and cover up your mistakes. cons:Poor quality no one cares of quality.Documents are forged a numbers are just made up on a daily basis.Hard work is penalized quality work is also penalized and you are retaliated on by The Slackers for making them look bad. Bottom line is it doesn't really matter how good or bad you are at your job just be friends with your supervisor no matter how much you hate them and they will make you look good.Can not take any issues to the HR department nothing will ever be done and they will just gossip to the shop about whatever you tell them.
6v9y4d,pros:It was a short drive to my job. Pay is good. You may learn some good concepts but never get to implement them. cons:No raise 2 out the 4 years. HR is horrible they let the union employees get away with murder. Supervisors do not stay because the Honeywell Aero Space in Southbend is a dysfunctional organization in 4 years I witnessed no less than 14 supervisors start and leave.
5v7o3a,"pros:Average medical insurance coverage at a high premium (this usually qualifies to be a bad thing) the brand name and occasional smart and dedicated coworkers cons:it's too big and inefficient. there are useless corporate mandates that do not fit the need or reality of each site that need to be complied regardless. long tenure corporate bureaucrats take pride in being stuck with the same company for 40 years and not seen anything else outside of honeywell. to make it worse, they prey on employees that do not fit their stereotype and improve process/procedure not know to honeywell"

2i2a4m,pros:Great People and Resources throughout the company. The environment is very competitive and it is a results driven organization. Good for people that are able to generate business on their own and are creative in maximizing their time and effort. cons:Benefits and pay are close to the lower end of the spectrum for a fortune 100 company. A lot of upper management changes creates constant changes to strategies and objectives. Implementations of processes and procedures also weigh heavily on employee morale.

9i7e5j,pros:Excellent benefit and pension plan cons:Poor quality of work life
0h1c7d,pros:Interesting work when you can find it. cons:9 Block performance review system sucks. Managers are encouraged to place a certain amount of employees in the low end of the scale. Management won't tell you specifics when receiving low performance rating. Too many dam meetings. New building is much smaller than old one. Everything is crammed into a smaller building.
6o3x6x,"pros:I am thankful to have been given the opportunity to work for Honeywell. I love my job, and the people I work with. cons:The benefits aren't so great, and management / HR can be very lackadaisical when it comes to allowing bad behavior from awful employees."

Diverse product lineup from avionics to propulsion turbo fan engine and competitive in turbocharger segment. cons:Directors and Managers lack real leadership skill, good old boys club and they only care their own success instead of providing clear objectives for the team.

8f3p2y,"pros:The Honeywell name has become synonymous with innovative technologies and materials. The have hundreds of facilities all over the world and have completed several acquisitions to further diversify. cons:Where should I start? I've been with this company for 14 years. I watched as former CEO Dave Cote completed several acquisitions, only to then watch the company ""spin off"" two divisions into new companies that now struggle.Attracting and retaining talent in an unknown concept. If you are negotiating your salary as a prospective employee, you better aim high because you're going to make that exact salary for most of your career. The employee evaluation system sets unrealistic goals to prevent pay raises.Perhaps the most damaging thing I've seen is CEO Dave Cote's ""Honeywell Operating System"" or HOS. It's his personal attempt to mimic the Toyota Operating System, a very time consuming and wasteful program was put in place. At my facility, 2-3 new manager positions were created just to oversee HOS. Production lagged and ultimately suffered."

5z6z1e,pros:Large corporation with a procedure for everything. Support services are above par. cons:Impersonal treatment from upper management. CEO has expressly stated that work/life issues are not a priority. Expensive insurance. Upper management has problems prioritizing and controlling large projects as they refuse to listen to engineers with decades of non-Honeywell experience.

0k0p3y,"pros:Honeywell is perfectly positioned to enter the Industrial IoT space and transition from creating physical products to analytics, digital products and AI. Problems awaiting analytic solutions are interesting and varied and a path to digital products should encounter few obstacles due to Honeywell breadth of expertise and variety of clients.Pros also include recently implemented unlimited vacation time (as long as your manager will approve) cons:Sadly the present CEO and his staff do not understand the difference between data driven digital products and standard software development. One bad decision after another in terms of organizational structure, endless reorgs and uninformed staffing pretty much guarantee that Honeywell will follow GE and IBM in their failure to transform from building physical things to digital.Benefits are much weaker than other similar size companies, from expensive healthcare to forced presence in the office. And this year ""innovation"" of the 401K match is truly horrible: Honeywell holds on to all employees matches till the January of the following year, this keeping to themselves all market gains of those funds. That is a robbery, loud and clear."

1m8c1b,"pros:The industry I am involved with is doing well. YOY growth.Pay is competitive if you come from the outside. cons:Continue to furlough employee's regularly along with downsizing.

Cost is very high.Starting compensation is good but does not progress with you.
4v4g8j,"pros:Large presence in Arizona with many sites and product lines so a lot of opportunity to change jobs or locations cons:Benefits cut year after year and cost increases every year; pay raises extremely low (if at all), bonuses permanently reduced for most managers, recurring work furloughs, and continuous reorganization resulting in layoffs. Very unhappy workforce"
1z2s5e,pros:The 401k company match is good. cons:Career prospects are limited. Aerospace is cyclical in general. Low growth and mature technology. Cost cutting is the name of the game to boost margins. Little investment is made in facilities and people such as training.
9v6y8w,"pros:Learned a lot, exposed to new ideas and people. cons:Raises are a joke, benefits are nonexistent, Less than zero support from corporate. Dead end if you don't have a four year degree because any management position requires one. Most sites are treated like a country club instead of a production facility and the only way to get fired is to rock the boat. Many long term employees are only staying for their pensions that are no longer offered for new employees. Salaries are not competitive in the area, the majority of interviews I had before finding new employment were offering 15 to 40% higher wages for similar or less responsibility."
9p8d7i,pros:Gaining experience to go somewhere else cons:No longer care about the employees
5v4y4j,pros:The people working were very nice. cons:The onboarding process is horrible. They sent notifications to my Honeywell email which I couldn't access.

3j7w3j,"pros:Good wages, clean environment cons:Greedy Ceo and upper management. Although wages are not bad the company takes and takes from the middle class people who make the money for them. They want to keep them down instead of rewarding them for all their hard work. Young people / new hires don't get pensions, long term emploees get their pensions froze, while the CEO make over 50 million with the stock options and bonuses. It's wrong."
2v9u1a,"pros:I love the actual work- troubleshooting issues with assembly processes, working with operators to make sure build instructions are clear and understandable.. cons:The corporate culture is terrible right now. I've heard from older coworkers that Honeywell was once a great place to work. Now they're having furloughs and layoffs left and right, taking away benefits, and management won't tell us what's going on. There are all sorts of rumors swirling around about divisions of the company being sold off and plants being closed."

3w2t0y,"pros:Honeywell is a great place for somebody who would prefer to sit back and produce literally nothing of value for years or even decades. Across Honeywell, I saw many who had mastered the art of looking busy while contributing almost nothing (aka, fake work). This is a place for someone who wants to fill their schedule with travel of dubious value or purpose. cons:Overall, a truly awful place to work. This is a review primarily of the ACST group, previously called SRDC and then CSTC. It will probably be renamed and re-shuffled several more times in the next 5 years. Regardless of the name, it is the group composed primarily of defense contractors in Golden Valley, MN.The defense/gov contractors get priority here. Anyone who wants to work on commercial products for regular consumers gets pushed aside. This group is simply a group of panhandlers for corporate welfare from the government.Management is incompetent. There is almost no direction from the higher ups. The only guiding motto is, paraphrasing: get more government money, and keep your work secret. The group is so heavily compartmentalized that almost no one works together. There is little sharing of knowledge and skills. I heard that some new employees sit around doing nothing with no direction. I don't feel that management encouraged or cared about my work.Management (across Honeywell) is slow at making any decisions and cannot move on opportunities. Bureaucracy is a problem.In my opinion, management, especially in ACST, is unethical and unprofessional.Gossip is a problem in ACST.The benefits at Honeywell are the worst of any company Ive seen. The companys new vacation policy of whatever number of days the employee feels like taking was an obvious theft of everyones vacation time. The health insurance is terrible with the highest deductibles and premiums of any company Ive seen. The required health screenings are awkward. Every year, management announces some new reduction in benefits. This year, they stopped subsidizing dental insurance.Despite Honeywell being founded and based in America, the broader company seems to be giving American jobs to other countries as vigorously as possible. Globalization is one of their primary goals. The outsourcing of American work is just driven by greed.In my opinion, Honeywell was at its peak circa 1960. The company has very little in-house innovation today. The products theyre in, such as thermostats, jet engines, barcode readers, and gas burners, are old technology. Honeywell just buys newer companies. When I think of high tech companies, Honeywell does not come to mind.In the broader Honeywell, Ive seen many layoffs, furloughs, and pay freezes."
2h5f3h,"pros:Work with talented/smart people in a modern facility. Advanced manufacturing technology is incorporated into production. Work/life balance is good. The culture is mostly positive. The salary is competitive. cons:Lots of work, need more people! Promotions can feel slow. Benefits aren't what they used to be. Some policy updates seem to punish retirees. No EV charging available."

2r0d7i,"pros:The work is challenging and for the most part, the people are really great. Good family work/life balance. Most managers allow flex-time schedules which is a huge benefit. cons:The pay for newer technicians (<10 years) is extremely below the market pay scales. There are no longer pension plans, 401K match is a pathetic .375% match up to 8% of you contributions for the first 6 years, and the benefits keep eroding every year. Quality of life is actually decreasing due to no raises and several unpaid furloughs. Factor that in with the terrible morale due to layoffs, unpaid furloughs, promotion freezes, outsource everything they possibly can (at the expense of quality) and rumors of the company getting sold..... it is not a great place."
1d5b5f,pros:Work is focused on results. Fast paced and you are given leeway in how you execute. cons:Try to do too many things at once. Analysis is often just to check a box and doesn't lead to action or change. Lots of time on Powerpoint just to present up the chain.
0p8o3z,"pros:Pay and benefits are good cons:Lack of employee appreciation, everyone is just a number."

You get the opportunity to work with great and smart people. cons:Work/life balance can be poor sometimes.

1h8x7j,"pros:Honeywell quality toolkit is outstanding. You'll learn a lot about improvement and efficiency. Stock is consistently strong. In Kansas City, factory closure between Christmas and New Year's is like an additional week of vacation. The new facility is beautiful. If you work for a good manager - and there are plenty - it's a good place to establish yourself professionally before moving along to a better opportunity. If you're an engineer, you'll have loads of opportunities to do interesting work and try different areas of focus. It's a good place if you're in IT, purchasing or finance, and a great place to work if you're in a skilled trade. The machinists are brilliant and deservedly well compensated. cons:In Kansas City, leadership is inconsistent and mercurial. There is a definite ""old boy"" mentality, and resistance to new ideas.The HR organization is mostly evil. If you're thinking of a job in communications, be careful. The manager takes a ""ready, fire, aim"" approach. She's quick to make decisions, not so much to think them through."

5a4q6o,pros:If you are an executive with equity compensation the stock has gone up for ten years. cons:Layoffs and furloughs are constant. No career paths. Morale is gone. IT function has so many controls in place you do nothing but fight through red tape. Starting a new project takes six months. Getting worse with even greater centralization of the function. Managers and even directors/VPs have no decision making authority. SVPs approve everything.

1s6b4l,"pros:Great people for the most part....I enjoyed working here and would go back. Being an Executive Admin is what I have done for so many years. My manager was the best, but then he retired, leaving me in the hands of the lions. They let Admins go and make the staff try to do their jobs as well as Admin work. cons:HR person used a confidential meeting I had with her to use against me to RIF me. She even stated that ""they"" hadn't even looked at the Admins for RIF's, until I went to talk to her of some of my concerns. Lesson learned on my part for sure. I wasn't even on a PIP, had always gone great reviews."
4y9u2d,"pros:Work and many nice people. cons:Benefits. Unrealistic schedules. Constant RIFs. Lack of real respect from management. Used to have real flex time and vacation. Now I have none, I have to ask permission to take a day off. But I am still expected to work overtime all the time."
8e4a9y,"pros:People: Everyone I work with on a day to day basis is great. Coworkers, direct supervisor and even the next level up in management are easy to work with and approachable.Diversity of Work: Able to work in many different capacities from design to production support to test. Keeps the day to day varied and fresh. cons:Work/Life Balance: Be prepared to work weekends. Since upper management decided to layoff everyone that wasn't absolutely critical remaining employees are being forced to pick up the slack. Now they are coming back with more layoffs and this is only going to get worse.Benefits: 401K matching is there but not great; 75% up to 8%. The insurance plans are a joke.Morale: Unsurprisingly overworked people that have to deal with multiple layoffs every year don't always bring the best attitudes into the office."

9a1y8h,"pros:Global company with lots of brand awareness. Good compensation. cons:Hard to navigate thru the Honeywell beast... and it's all about leadership making their big bonuses at the end of the day.

7l9g9x,"pros:Company car that I pay almost $200 per month forGood rates for life insuranceGood co-workersAppreciative customers cons:You are nothing but a number. It took over a year to get to new hire orientation, and in that year I went through three managers. The first two never even had time to give me the time of day, the third acted as though I should be completely up to speed on this incredibly complex company and industry with zero training and support. The pay structure is laughable, bonuses are impossible to get because the growth number they expect from the sales rep are literally five times the number that the company projects as a whole. Constant pressure and micro management. Layer upon layer of middle and upper management. Seriously, its a nightmare...Oh yeah, how about the benefits. They only offer high deductible health plans. So my family had to pay $400 per month for medical insurance, plus a $3000 deductible before they paid for anything but routine checkups. Meanwhile the CEO gets a huge raise and Honeywell pulls in billions in profit. And NEW FOR 2017! Honeywell makes no contribution towards dental! Oh yeah, and when they eventually match your 401k contributions after a year, they do it with Honeywell stock! So if you want to invest in something else you have to go in and sell that stock and reinvest it."

3z8e9p,pros:The people are the best asset to this company. They are friendly and knowledgeable. The work is very interesting and challenging. I really like my boss and find he is very supportive of my work. cons:Honeywell is adding so many tools and processes and requirements to the responsibilities of a design engineer that it is impossible to truly focus on creating quality designs. The network and CAD system are the worst I have ever seen and as a former design engineer contractor I have seen at least 10 other well performing systems. The upper management is so focused on profit that it has lost it's ability to see why its implementation of new processes and tools are costing money.
1e4f4m,pros:They bring in good people. It's big enough you kind find something else to do if you don't like your current role and they seem to encourage that. cons:They treat people like tools and numbers. You're always two levels removed from anyone who can make any decisions and they hide behind the rules they make up.

Raises are terrible and new people being trained to train the older regular people. The new people are running the show and the quality is not there. They are being paid more or the same as people that have been there along time. Insurance is to high to keep. If you buddy your supervisor you will work your way up, and hanging out with leads is the way to move up too. What will that do for your raise???"

You learn so much from people that have been in the industry for 20+ years. cons:There is too much focus on finances and budgets, management is pressured to reduce cost to serve, and high level management is only looking out for company profits. There are layoffs every few years and furloughs. The company does not value loyalty and doesn't take care of its employees."

I would recommend this company to those that like to thrive in an ever changing environment. cons:No work life balance. Project implementations required 80 hour work weeks and when finished a 50 hour standard work week was expected. All core functions seemed to be going to contractors and not Honeywell Employees.

0w0g9o,"pros:Not sure there are many left. There is some exceptional talent left to learn from. cons:HR and business people run the company. They do not care about technical excellence just cutting costs and making the stock go up at the expense of a future. Minimal raises, benefits cut year after year, 5 layoffs in 2 1/2 years, furloughs, management changed to people that do not understand the business, or reasons for past failures. Extremely poor work-life balance. One of the poorest customer satisfactions rating in Aerospace."

Not sure how that can be legal. Had I known prior to coming here, it would have impacted my decision."
3f1z5t,pros:Work Life Schedule is good as there are times one can work from home. Allowed to work on different projects cons:An industry that is difficult to change and modernize. Retiring workforce without new engineers to maintain or improve the product.
3o5q5n,pros:The job is there is you want it. You will learn a lot while you are employed with Honeywell. cons:Dont expect to be paid what you are worth. Honeywell is consistently going through organizational transformation and chews through its general management/leadership. Very little employee recognition happens here. Work life balance can be a struggle.
7u4z0h,"pros:When working on important programs, there is lots of money for tooling and prototypes. cons:No money for raises. Frequent years with no merit increases for the whole company. Limited advancement opportunities for non-software technical talent. Most future US hiring now targeting Atlanta. Most technical hiring is now in Mexico or China. Product management frequently makes major changes mid-program, but demands schedules not change resulting in long days and working weekends.Everyone expects new ""unlimited"" vacation policy will be used to severely limit vacation taken. Every year the benefits are significantly reduced. In 2017 we lost the company contribution to dental, earned vacation, and flexibility to work from home, even occasionally. In previous years we had already been limited to expensive high deductible health plans, lost our company contribution for vision, lost our company contribution to our HSA, and lost the ability to borrow from our 401(k).Morale is so low that employees openly discuss state of their job search."

The work is very challenging and is a great springboard for new engineers who want to gain knowledge for moving to different companies that respect employees experiences cons:Management demands more productivity with less resources, funding, and schedule. 60 hour weeks are the norm and expected. Product quality is poor and requirements appear to be optional for mission critical systems."

Brilliant, creative, and friendly co-workers who work together for success.4. Fast-paced work environment where I'm allowed to focus on what matters most and not so much on the bureaucracy.5. Reasonable and common-sense manager who cares more about getting the job done and done ethically rather than how or where it gets done.6. Managers who know that it's hard to accomplish a lot when I have too many projects at the same time and who work hard to help me to not get bogged down.I could go on... cons:1. Big company bureaucracy requires some work to figure out when first starting, though it doesn't affect my daily job much."
7q3h3p,pros:Hires good engineers who develop excellent technology cons:Tends to hire and promote white males with Ivy league education. Benefits have been significantly reduced. Too many organizational and management changes. Systems and processes are designed to feed senior leadership with information and too much time is wasted in submitting this information. Tends to hire too may people in senior management roles with no one to do the work - need more worker bees rather than directors who make power point slides.
2s5a2v,pros:Very interesting work that is exciting with opportunities to grow and develop new skills that are valuable to develop one's career. cons:Site is experiencing major job shrinkage and the employee moral is quite low at this moment.

Ratings are somewhat based on if you are in the right clique.
5e3v8l,pros:Lot of overtime and ability to learn a lot of different jobs and skills. Machining and assembly processes are on site together. cons:no job security at all. No permanent job openings available to temps working at the company for years. No benefits and pay is okay but could be better.

9t7t7b,"pros:Good local coworkers, commiserate together cons:Mobile is a terrible city to live. Corporate management live their lives for shareholders and stock market. Sold their souls to money.

0g0p9g,pros:Good working environment and technological advancement cons:Slow advancement and difficult to be permanent
3w1y7c,pros:A technology-driven company that gives employees the opportunity to learn and get experience in a lot of different applications.

So you are pushed and measured by schedule but they put barriers all along the way like failure is by design.Jobs are sent to China or India even if you can show that it is cheaper to do it here. Not just production jobs but engineering too. Merger & Acquisition is the means of growth so always looking to buy a company, cut workforce and move product line to China,"

2r8j8w,pros:A huge company which gives you access to multiple levels of a B2B value chain. Many Options to switch from one business to another. Strategic Marketing drives decision making. cons:The HR function is completely superseded by the line management! Line managers are often promoted salesman and not specialists. Which means a number of functions start behaving like sales.
5c1s2y,"pros:Pros are no longer present due to reduced benefits, frequent unpaid furloughs, and layoffs. cons:Week long unpaid furloughs company-wide followed by layoffs several times per year, agreed-to salary is sometimes reduced without consent, anything is possible to inflate the CEO Dave Cote's exit package. You will pay for acquisitions, not Honeywell."
7w4v9d,"pros:Less likely to be outsourced due to the classification of the contracts. cons:Management thinks employees are complete idiots, trying to tell us ""to improve employee loyality"" while making a cash grab from the employees by holding all the 401K matches until next year. They even told us in January they needed cash, so they took it from the only people they could, the employees."
2o8e0r,"pros:Seemed to be actively seeking change. Utilizing LEAN concepts and daily engagement. Management spoke a good game. cons:When push came to shove they stuck with ""its the Honeywell way.""

3d6g1m,pros:A lot of hours. cons:Blood sucking management. A bunch of yes men who have no skill.
8d3k6z,"pros:The paycheck has never bounced. cons:Health Benefits are poor, vacation accrual time is poor, only 2 weeks at onset, takes 5 years to earn more. They promote based on who's willing to take on extra responsibility and blame with no pay raise rather than knowledge or experience. Therefore management turnover rate is high here and no one wants to move up to work as management.They just don't take care of their employees. They cut or shutdown their supply depots, 5S their spare inventory out of the building and then question why production is down.Their motif is a corporate greed motif. Layoff employees. Shutdown production and supply lines right before quarterly analyses so that way cost goes down because you have LESS employees and LESS material for them to actually accomplish their job, BLAME LOCAL MANAGEMENT, SELL OFF HALF YOUR STOCK MR. CEO, ATTEMPT TO MERGE WITH YET ANOTHER COMPANY using the inflated profit you usurped from NOT INVESTING IN YOUR OWN COMPANY, and yeah this company is not going to be around for long. Honeywell is a Vampire. It just sucks the blood out of every small company it picks up and moves on."
4f0f8l,"pros:Able to utilize existing world class new product introduction methodologies and tool sets. Honeywell velocity product introduction builds in additional rigor with the ultimate goal of being faster, better, stronger, organized and metric centric. cons:Leadership team and structure transitions every 1-2 years. New initiatives which require culture change are continually being rolled out. The constant upheavals are exhausting. Difficult to deploy great tools like VPD when the structure and leaders are constantly changing.Benefit cost increases outpace salary increases."

Flexible vacation days. cons:Very mediocre benefits package. Particularly our medical coverage. Low contributions to 401k. Takes 3 years to divest shares.

1t9a3w,"pros:Being a big company there are a lot of opportunities to move around. As of now they still provide a 401(k) match, but it's going to get cut soon. cons:Aerospace division is significantly hurting. Business is extremely slow and the management is taking away from employees to meet their annual numbers.The company has cut the 2016 salary down by 10% already by the way of furloughs. There was no merit increase in 2016 and no increase expected in 2017 either. There was a lay off in Q2 of 2016 and there are rumors of additional lay off in Q1 2017. Recently, the CEO decided there Telecommuting is no longer allowed and would required approval from the President of the company. This in 2016 is ridiculous. The reason givenwas that face to face interactions drive collaboration and faster decisions. At the same time the company encourages us to send work to India. I've nothing against it but these two things don't go together.For the last 9-12 months it almost feels like the company is instituting policies to drive us away so that they don't have to pay severance when they lay us off."

6r0c0n,"pros:Nice people. Can keep your airline miles. Bathrooms are kept clean. Cubes are clean. Starbucks coffee is available in the cafeteria. Pop is free. That's the best I can do here... cons:Worst company to work for. Ever. Horrible environment, terrible leadership, no respect for employees. No benefits or appreciation for anything employees do. Furloughs, no raises, terrible bonus. Very stressful, no work/family balance. No work from home policy. A culture of dishonesty with leadership and caring more about their egos than having an honest conversation about how to fix problems. Can't hire decent smart people because they are so desperate to fill roles after a hiring freeze. I have more than 25 years experience in my field and I would rather work at Menards as a cashier. This place is dismal all over the company."

Everyone is very communicative, and conversation is good so far. The internal web portals are very well organized, and getting settled in has been a breeze.Honeywell so far has come across as a company that really wants to make an investment in their employees, allowing them to grow in their profession. cons:If you are going into software looking for a fancy skyscraper office looking out over a city, this isn't exactly it. You will probably get your standard cubicle, although the equipment provided is pretty nice.Honeywell is a bit more of an older company, and they are heavy in government contract work. While it seems that many of their new policies are pretty progressive, their seems to be a fair amount of cookie cutter government paperwork / red tape / corporate kind of activity that goes on (such as redundant or unnecessarily extensive training videos, or lots of digging to get access to materials / information to move forward with projects)."

6v4s3r,"pros:Great opportunity to learnGreat co-workers, many dedicated employeesGood pay, benefits used to be excellent but started chaning the past few years cons:Short term financial focus is driving bad behaviors in leadership - saw situtations where layoffs were required dues to financials and right after the end of the quarter sites were scrambling to fill hourly positions. Site Leaders have thankless jobs!!!Short term focus negatively impacting what started out as a positive step forward, i.e. Honeywell Operating System. Its all about end of month / end of quarter.Exodus of alot of good talentWork environment became toxic over past couple years"

3x9x9a,"pros:I got a mediocre paycheck (when we werent on furlough) and, well, I cant think of anything else. They had a decent cafeteria but that was outsourced and run by another company. cons:Management, Waldren specifically, have no interest in the employees. They outsource everything to the lowest bidder which ends up delivering bad products. Little to no raises. Furloughs even though the company was making money. Health benefits get cut back more and more every year. Its cost over everything. They dont want American workers. The moral when I left was terrible with people leaving it wanting to leave."
3t4y9s,"pros:I had a lot of success as an intern at Honeywell. My advice is to network and be seen. No one will hold your hand to accomplishing anything, but it is within your power to reach out and grab the opportunities that are there. cons:The older engineers are stuck in their ways and resistant to change. Don't trust anyone in HR. They go looking for gossip and act on it before speaking to you. You must hold your own council. They are not there to help you."

8w2j5i,"pros:Good work hours, good coworkers. cons:Company makes billions in profits every year, always making excuses why they can't give raises. There is only 1 reason employees don't receive raises, GREED."
8y9n9a,pros:Honeywell hires a quality staff and there are a lot of off site benefits working with Honeywell. cons:The current aerospace climate has created a lot of unsteady work for the employees. There have been a few furloughs followed by lay offs and restructuring . This leaves the weight of work on good people who are unable to leave for various reasons.
9g0w4v,"pros:The people you work with will make this job much more bearable. Good starting salary but maybe don't let that fool you; I'll explain in the cons section. Pretty good work life balance. Not too many others I can think of. cons:Management plays favorites. Constantly going through riffs and layoffs. Even when we have a great year there will be layoffs. It's just management trying to meet their bottom line. Cost of living raises are a joke (if you even get one). If you get promoted the pay bump will make you wonder why you even tried to get a promotion in the first place. Benefits get worse every year. This year it was our health insurance that got worse as well as more expensive. Turnover rate is insane. Within two years you will see at least half the people you work with leave for a better opportunity. The only people still there are the ones with 30+ years who are grandfathered in to the pension plan. They dont do pensions anymore. They dont match 401K for the first year, and they do that probably because so many people leave after a year or two. I could go on and on but just try to find a better opportunity first."
2j7w5v,pros:Great company that treats its employees well cons:They do not utilize there ERP system to near it's full potential. Overtime could be cut by 50% plus

9r9y4k,"pros:Good group of people in department cons:The CEO does not care about the employees and I'm shocked that his rating is at 65%. You can't ask a question without feeling belittled. The employees have not seen any benefit to the Trump tax reduction. Worst benefits ever! Can't work from home. Rumors flying about locations closing. Employees are so stressed and yet we are expected to give more. Multiple furloughs.... Don't do it! With all of this , they want the employees to refer people they know. Never!!"

Benefits are continually eroding, and local HR has zero pull to make any changes.Engineering organization is split into multiple silos, with competing metrics.

3s6q7g,"pros:Flex time, 9/80 work schedule, Vision and Dental plans, some of the best people i have ever met work at the Kansas City Plant. cons:Senior management has no clue what is going on down on the factory floor. Discrimination in a common occurrence in this company. There is a transgendered employee in the plant that gets targeted on a daily basis. If you are not a white man, then you are treated like you dont know anything. The bad thing is that HR doesnt even care.The union protects poor performing employees, even employees that break the law."

7a8a8v,"pros:Good Money. Usually a good amount overtime (You'll need it to pay for your Health insurance) cons:Honeywell is powered by Corporate Greed. They have a notorious reputation for offering very poor union contracts to their unionized plants. When these contracts are rejected, they kick their employees out into the street and replace them with a temporary work force that look like a group from a prison work release program. They leave their loyal workers out in the street (for years sometimes) until they have to sign the lousy contract. Don't believe me, Google it."
0z9g6z,"pros:Culture of mobility, common to move from one job to another every couple years. Allows working in program management without working from the bottom of engineering to the top (or in engineering at all). cons:Big company means you may just have one little piece of the puzzle instead of wearing major multiple different hats at once (sales, development, customer support, etc) with far-reaching scope."
2c5a9q,"pros:Lots of work with minimal supervision. Great people to work with, but often disconnected with management due to size of organization. cons:Budget cuts lead to staff reductions.

9r7t6y,pros:Lean processes and Honeywell Operating System creates a standard work environment where expectations are well know and communication freely flows from one area to another. cons:Company is very concerned about the bottom line to the detriment of employees. Large variances in salaries for same jobs. Reliance of contract hires with reluctance to hire or convert employees to permanent. Standardization creates machine-like workforce who no longer are able to think for themselves or solve problems quickly and efficiently.

2n6c3z,pros:Challenging work that offers lots of opportunity to learn and grow. Great knowledge base of senior peers to help learn complex technology. cons:Dave Cote strip mines the businesses and employees to make the numbers each quarter. No raises in 2 years and furloughs which resulted in a reduction in pay. Keep in mind this is taking place while the stock is at all time highs.
5d5n7n,"pros:Competitive salaries, flexible schedule, excellent opportunities for growth, and great relocation packages. cons:Not so great health insurance and other benefits."
6i1a4f,"pros:Some incredibly talented people to work with. cons:Unfortunately, senior management is a ""good old boy"" network of pathetically untalented individuals whose only interest is moving up and maintaining their bonuses. Too many cheifs and 1 % of the indians doing 99% of the work. Management doesn't care about the company at all!"

Very little leadership development, corporate micromanaging, very negative and frustrating place to work. no investment in employees, it's a revolving door of young motivated people trying to make a name for themselves at the bottom of the pay scale. They cancel annual raises, cut training programs like Green belt doc Sigma, old dirty building that has water leaking through the roof when it rains. Benefits are discouraging."
2b7q4z,pros:Challenging day to day. Opportunity to learn. cons:Hard work not always recognized
4e0d1p,pros:Great support system with Program Managers having your back. The ability to learn through their LMS system is amazing and free. Their concern for your safety and the overall company is fantastic. When payed off severance package is offered. cons:Health insurance is awful with a $3000 deductible then 80/20 but a lot of prescriptions are free.

1r5o6k,pros:Good knowledge base and great place to gain good experiences to get on your resume. Most people are great to work with and are easy to get along with. cons:Executive leadership is ruining morale. Leadership above site level is only about making the numbers and could care less about employee well being. Average employee receives two furloughs within a 7 month period while bonuses are still issued.
5i7u7f,"pros:Close to home, good place to learn, then get the hell out cons:What was once a super company to work in now just a stepping stone. Benefits are poor, pay raises are few and far between. Heavy OT and no recognition. If you do not have connections do not work here, the atmosphere is venomous . Again if you do not have personal connections you will not move up."
9q9u4t,"pros:good 401k program and matching cons:bad employee policies, capricious work from home policy, management (SPS) is never satisfied with any financial metric, typical employee is never secure - there is always the objective to replace with lower cost or outsourced - regardless of how many times the CEO says ""our employees are our greatest asset"".

1u6i9u,"pros:Compensation is fairly competitive as other similar size corporations likes GD, except for company sponsored health insurance. Good compensation for 401k match, 75%. Salary range is about market value. cons:Work is more exciting at commercial aviation segments, space and defense mostly have maintenance programs, and not so much going with Cost plus programs. Most of the big programs normally go budget overrun. There is mandatory overtime (now politically referred to as ""Engineering Efficiency Index"") 10% requirement highly encouraged and is tracked for performance review and merit determination. The issue with it is that it makes it difficult to meet the ""OT"" yield when work is slow but you're still expected to fulfill that objective. Otherwise, you get busy and go easily over 10% with the active ramp-up projects. Budget for burden projects are not approved easily."
5o1j7b,pros:Good pay and benefit package with the exception of health insurance. Company paid pension plan and company match on 401K contributions are excellent cons:Initiatives pushed down from the corporate level are sometimes a hindrance at the shop floor level. Work/life balance is difficult due to workload and staffing shortages
9q3r1m,pros:The old Intermec people were great prior to being acquired By HSM. cons:After being acquired by HSM the culture completely changed. Management openly said they do not care if people leave...get on the bus or get off is something that was said often.
1r2k2l,"pros:I feel my position is stable. In addition, there are many other opportunities in a company this size. Those opportunities can be in a different field or different business unit and even a different industry. cons:The company is very focused on a lean operation - to the extent that it becomes hard to get anything done. Everyone is overworked. People you rely on are slow to respond -or just flat out tell you they can't support you. But that doesn't stop the pressure to produce. Company culture is all about getting the job done. There is no sense of team. You are a small cog in a big machine."

Honeywell FMT no longer has a college reimbursement, they charge you for smoking, they charge you based on your Body Mass Index, they have high management turn over, and they require you to turn in 12 continuous improvements a year. That many improvements bottles up the systems and a lot of work is overhead. The real work comes second to Honeywell corporate.

Schedules are flexible. 401k match used to be better but still pretty good compared to the industry. cons:Where to begin...this company being mismanaged from the top down and it is extremely management top heavy. Raises are almost non-existent on top of the below average pay. Schedules are made to meet customer demands as opposed to the reality of engineering/design schedules. Furloughs and layoffs are becoming regular practice. A lot of design and engineering work is being shipped overseas while the domestic workforce continues to be shrunk. Used to be a much more pleasant work environment, in fact the only thing keeping this review from being a 1 star rating are the people you get to interact with on a daily basis. Healthcare benefits?

You do get benefits (although you should expect that they will be reduced over time - as happened throughout my 13 years with the company). cons:Typical Corporation mentality rewarding only stockholders & UPPER management.

7l5g8v,pros:Colleagues are focused on customers. cons:Leadership team does not have a solid plan to move the organization forward.
7a7e9c,"pros:Most people have heard the name, even if they don't know what sort of products or services are offered, therefore it looks better on a resume than less well known companies. cons:1) Corporate greed runs rampant. One week they are sharing news of how well the company did last quarter and what great profits they had, and the next week they are sending out internal memos about spending and travel freezes so that we can perform to what the shareholders were promised. They always put the shareholders first, even when the actions to do so will negatively impact customers (many of the decrees are very short sighted). Customers come second and employees place last by a long shot.2) Honeywell buys well performing companies, takes their customer base, their IP, their suppliers, and anything else they can gut, and then outsources to the foreign country flavor of the month. If you work for a US based company that is bought by Honeywell, expect to see your job outsourced to China, Mexico, or India within 1-2 years. The outsourcing announcement was officially made at my company at the 1.5 yr mark, but the original plan began circling in upper levels of management around the 6 month mark, which is a pretty good indication that outsourcing was the plan from day 1.3) Honeywell is a ""check the box"" company. It does not matter if your actions produced valuable results, as much as it matters that you can say you did what the job required. On a regular basis, I see employees and leadership going through the motions to check the box, but not even caring about the outcome.4) Honeywell is so big that it is very common that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. It is pretty much a daily occurrence in some meeting or another.5) Honeywell invests massively into ""High Growth Regions"", which includes countries like China, India, and pretty much any country where employees are paid dirt. Yet, they have no respect for the American lives that they screw up when they lay off long-term employees in order to show headcount reductions.6) Top management makes millions of dollars per year, and yet the company ""struggles"" to do well in a tight economy, so it is most important that employees understand when the blue-collar and no-collar jobs need to be cut in order for the company to look good to investors."

Always receiving the work instructions to correct it or an excellent answer to continue processing as normal. I was never told ""because I said.""I helped build products I was 100% confident were built right because I had this this support to fall back on when I needed. cons:Cost cutting culture concerning manpower and resources, Constant expectations to meet budget and schedule milestones that seem to be unattainable."

There is actually a large department at corporate that is dedicated to processing layoffs and there have been so many layoffs that there are not enough people to deliver product to the customer (there are major product quality issues and most products are delivered late).Low pay scales, no merit pay raises (for the past 6 years), no bonus pay (for the past 2 years), annual pay cuts (typically 10%), and horrible benefits (high premiums; dental benefits completely cut).Low morale due to continuous layoffs, horrible management, and poor financial metrics (employees don't understand how the company reports record growth/profits to investors, but internally employees hear that revenue is down across all divisions).Management lacks integrity, ethics, and accountability (corporate lawyers make decisions based on ""We don't think we will get caught""). There are major violations of federal law that could potentially bar the company from business.Very few opportunities for employee training or career development. No career advancement opportunities.""Honeywell Operating System"" (HOS) is ridiculous - it is simply standard work that the company should already do.Declining company reputation makes it extremely difficult to recruit talent. I had several open reqs and only ~10 applicants over 6 months for each one; every applicant asked me about the company's poor reviews and reputation."

Stack ranking style reviews. Micromanagement through the use of HOS rules right down to what you can throw in your trash can. A pay scale that used to be transparent - now it is a big secret. Lack of merit raises or promotion on said secret pay scale. Benefits that have been constantly culled.

Actually, the only reason they survive is through acquisition of companies that are more successful. It's like the aliens in the move Independence Day - they swoop in, suck all the life out of the once successful, thriving organization, and then move on to their next victim. Sad but very true. Don't give them the time of day. Trust me you don't want to work here."

0a7p5t,pros:Working with geniuses everyday and being part of innovation is amazing! The structured areas of expertise is a organized well for new products and production products. cons:Health Insurance is expensive and they have gotten rid of their pensions.
5i3g9o,"pros:Flexible work hours. My star ratings are an average of my immediate situation of the last few years, my situation the decade before that, and what I see going on among all the people with whom I work.My immediate manager is an amazing anomaly, constantly pushing us to move up the ladder, explaining the boxes that need to be checked off so upper management can't block our promotions and how to navigate the god-awful politics and get around the massive road block that is ""HR"", the Lawsuit Prevention Squad. Upper management would get rid of him if they knew what he was doing for us as it goes against the one and only commandment of ""Thou Shalt Cut Costs At All Cost!."" None of the other managers I have had in the last 15 years had the stones to even try to explain what it really takes to get promoted in this environment. Just promote the ones you like. Most didn't even understand our group's true function, and considered all of us unpromotable because 'you only do ...' My present manager is the only reason I could give anything 2 stars. cons:Where to start...don't be fooled, darius is dave's clone without a personality (which can be pos or neg depending on your point of view). Other than the very small bubble I am currently in, what I see going on around me is appalling. The last 5-6 years have been a rapidly accelerating descent through chaos into indifference. Read the other reviews for details, what they describe is spot on. Don't be fooled by the company sponsored 4-5 star 1-2 sentence reviews that are probably required in bulk of HR minions so they can be promoted. The best employees are loaded up to the point of collapse/quitting as they try to keep things afloat with no support from their managers, the best of whom are also overloaded and completely hamstrung by upper management's greed for ever larger bonuses. The company is being hollowed out by upper management skimming off the top while the employees doing the work get less and less for their efforts. When management states there is 'really no way to measure customer satisfaction' you are forced to realize just how deep the hole you are in really is. And in spite of everything they won't stop digging; they dig faster and harder."

The employees have not seen any benefit to the Trump tax reduction. Worst benefits ever! Can't work from home. Rumors flying about locations closing.

No more ability to work from home. Instead, they make us all sit in an awful open floor plan that looks like a prison yard and makes people miserable. Vacation policy for non-exempt employees is weak. The insurance is pretty much the worse I've ever had. Layoffs are common. Morale stinks for a reason. American jobs given to Indians without care or thought. I tell everyone who will listen about this in particular. Honeywell doesn't give a damn about hollowing out the American middle class."

Having portfolio divisions allows Honeywell to ride out economic down-cycles better than most other firms. Progressive HR that values business partnering and business acumen. Great training for early career HR professionals. cons:A company this size will obviously have politics, red tape, and bureaucracy.

6t1p3m,"pros:Honeywell is a great place for somebody who would prefer to sit back and produce literally nothing of value for years or even decades. Across Honeywell, I saw many who had mastered the art of looking busy while contributing almost nothing (aka, fake work). This is a place for someone who wants to fill their schedule with travel of dubious value or purpose. cons:Overall, a truly awful place to work. This is a review primarily of the ACST group, previously called SRDC and then CSTC. It will probably be renamed and re-shuffled several more times in the next 5 years. Regardless of the name, it is the group composed primarily of defense contractors in Golden Valley, MN.The defense/gov contractors get priority here. Anyone who wants to work on commercial products for regular consumers gets pushed aside. This group is simply a group of panhandlers for corporate welfare from the government.Management is incompetent. There is almost no direction from the higher ups. The only guiding motto is, paraphrasing: get more government money, and keep your work secret. The group is so heavily compartmentalized that almost no one works together. There is little sharing of knowledge and skills. I heard that some new employees sit around doing nothing with no direction. I don't feel that management encouraged or cared about my work.Management (across Honeywell) is slow at making any decisions and cannot move on opportunities. Bureaucracy is a problem.In my opinion, management, especially in ACST, is unethical and unprofessional.Gossip is a problem in ACST.The benefits at Honeywell are the worst of any company Ive seen. The companys new vacation policy of whatever number of days the employee feels like taking was an obvious theft of everyones vacation time. The health insurance is terrible with the highest deductibles and premiums of any company Ive seen. The required health screenings are awkward. Every year, management announces some new reduction in benefits. This year, they stopped subsidizing dental insurance.Despite Honeywell being founded and based in America, the broader company seems to be giving American jobs to other countries as vigorously as possible. Globalization is one of their primary goals. The outsourcing of American work is just driven by greed.In my opinion, Honeywell was at its peak circa 1960. The company has very little in-house innovation today. The products theyre in, such as thermostats, jet engines, barcode readers, and gas burners, are old technology. Honeywell just buys newer companies. When I think of high tech companies, Honeywell does not come to mind.In the broader Honeywell, Ive seen many layoffs, furloughs, and pay freezes."
2u8l3r,"pros:There is a lot of freedom to work on what youPay is pretty decent cons:The tier system used is archaic at this point and leads to a lot of pointless meetings.Work life balance was awful, if you proved you were useful you would be forced to work 50+ a week while the useless employees could skate by at 40.Do not expect a title change, you have to apply to higher positions and compete with internal and external candidates and if you do not get the position you get locked out for up to 6 months.Due to the large rate of people quitting the team was always understaffed since the company will only post positions at the new yearYou have to watch an insane amount of training videos and due to the metrics of leadership these can take priority over line down issues"

Minimal raises, benefits cut year after year, 5 layoffs in 2 1/2 years, furloughs, management changed to people that do not understand the business, or reasons for past failures.

Health insurance cost rises 10-20% per year for lowest coverage of any major company. 1 week furloughs every quarter. No pay increase in 3 of the last 8 years. No mentoring of young engineers.

Deductible is very high, and you get no assistance whatsoever until you meet the deductible. No copay assigned for a doctor's visit, so you'll be paying $100+ for every appointment until you meet your deductible.Executives are out of touch with employees. When there is a problem, the solution is to throw the ""12 Behaviors,"" ""Honeywell User Experience,"" ""Honeywell Operating System,"" and ""HPD Goals"" in employees' faces, instead of addressing underlying problems.Most employees are urged to ""stay off the radar"" of senior managers, directors and executives, leading to a stressful and distrusting work environment.Most divisions have layoffs and furloughs throughout the year, leading to low morale within the company."

Opportunities if you like to move around the country. I never understood this policy. Why not keep good people within the same plant? cons:Dave ""take the shoes off my kids feet"" Cote will do anything to his employees to make the bottom line and pad his own pockets. I hear he may be leaving soon. About 5 years ago, he set out his goal to have the stock hit $120. It did touch there, so maybe he'll back off a little. The stock was at like $35 when he made that pronouncement. He achieved his goal at his employees expense. now he's dismantling the company to make numbers in a form of desperation. He sold off / spun off the biggest Nylon division and all its supporting companies from Hopewell VA. This is a desperate move to make quarterly numbers.

Not too many others I can think of. cons:Management plays favorites. Constantly going through riffs and layoffs. Even when we have a great year there will be layoffs. It's just management trying to meet their bottom line. Cost of living raises are a joke (if you even get one). If you get promoted the pay bump will make you wonder why you even tried to get a promotion in the first place. Benefits get worse every year. This year it was our health insurance that got worse as well as more expensive. Turnover rate is insane. Within two years you will see at least half the people you work with leave for a better opportunity. The only people still there are the ones with 30+ years who are grandfathered in to the pension plan. They dont do pensions anymore. They dont match 401K for the first year, and they do that probably because so many people leave after a year or two. I could go on and on but just try to find a better opportunity first."

0h5r4p,"pros:The paychecks haven't bounced yet. cons:Management continues to chase short-term dollars in a myopic exercise to increase shareholder value. In the process, they continually overwork and push employees to deliver with no reward. As a thank you for a year of hard work, long days, urgent calls in the middle of the night, and weekend travel to other sites; senior leadership is instituting a manual furlough (unpaid time off work) the first week in January. They are also not modifying delivery expectations and somehow, programs and projects will magically continue to progress despite no effort.This review is long on the short, but the work life balance, policies, and way people are treated is appalling, and many have been here so long they don't know any better. There's no way Honeywell can transition into a top-flight software company with their current mentality. There's no vision; and if there is one out there, it's certainly not shared.They've brought in some incredible talent with the lure of building some massively innovative products; but each of those products requires a death march of a project to get them done and a LOT of people are fed up. Expect the smart and capable ones to start jumping ship in early January when other companies ramp up their hiring.DON'T LISTEN TO THE BS RECRUITERS GIVE YOU, THIS PLACE IS A PRISON WORK CAMP!"

When having a tough quarter, expect leadership to impose an unpaid furlough on employees to save money. ""Employees are our most important asset"" is lip service only - in actuality, employees are viewed as disposable, so they can be replaced with an H1-B from India.

4p0a5c,pros:401K MatchStable predictable 1.5% annual raiseSupplier discounts when purchasing a new car cons:Management does not have the power to invoke real changeHoneywell does not pay commissions timely hoping you will give upComp plans were delivered up to 6 months into the yearCommission rates went down and OTE remained the same forcing a lot of talented people out of the companyDuring the exit interview I was not asked why I was leaving.Bottom line they dont care about the sales or services team
7y3q4x,"pros:The brand is very strong. It's remarkable how much people appreciate it. In a sense, I'd say the financial practices are a pro. The company seems to be run as a best-in-class holdings company. I don't foresee it ever disappearing, or losing money for the matter. cons:It's a large, old company that's transforming. Not a new story. Needs to shake off the rust and modernize. Benefits are disappointing, culture is disappointing, organizational structure is very disappointing. I think its best innovations come in the form of FP&A, not technology - that's a con."
2w8q5q,pros:engineers might like itget compensated ok cons:Leadership not aligned with values and doesnt care about individual contributors. No Planning
5a2e2r,"pros:Honeywell has a few good supervisors but with all the greed and games they can't help their employees. If I could give no stars I would. cons:Horrible pay for a company its size. Multiple furloughs last year year, quarterly furloughs this year along with RIFs and no overtime. Same work load with way less people. Very bitter work staff. HR isnt worth a damn, you have an issue with anyone or thing and it seems the whole plant finds out."
4w0q4x,"pros:good benefits - insurance, vacation and 401K match. cons:large company with lots of red tape that slows job effectiveness."
5b0x3c,pros:Decent health care benefit coverage cons:Company is making there employees feel more like a number

0t9a8r,pros:Wonderful Place to work and also a great job security cons:Not much help can be got from oldies
2m6i9g,"pros:Honeywell is perfectly positioned to enter the Industrial IoT space and transition from creating physical products to analytics, digital products and AI. Problems awaiting analytic solutions are interesting and varied and a path to digital products should encounter few obstacles due to Honeywell breadth of expertise and variety of clients.Pros also include recently implemented unlimited vacation time (as long as your manager will approve) cons:Sadly the present CEO and his staff do not understand the difference between data driven digital products and standard software development. One bad decision after another in terms of organizational structure, endless reorgs and uninformed staffing pretty much guarantee that Honeywell will follow GE and IBM in their failure to transform from building physical things to digital.Benefits are much weaker than other similar size companies, from expensive healthcare to forced presence in the office. And this year ""innovation"" of the 401K match is truly horrible: Honeywell holds on to all employees matches till the January of the following year, this keeping to themselves all market gains of those funds. That is a robbery, loud and clear."
0o8e6z,pros:Some really smart people work there cons:Not a lot of opportunity for creativity or use of your own mind. Regardless of the internal hype ... they are NOT doing cutting edge HR work here.

0v2c0e,"pros:New & rewarding work on tech development projects that produce systems & software products that enhance automation, usability and safety of avionics systems deployed for commercial & business aircraft. cons:Support of metrics collection on progress towards milestones and repetitive quoting of project costs steals engineering time that should be applied to quality systems development, integration & testing as well as work on patents."
3n3q2o,pros:The company does have a goal to be global industry leader. There are many innovative and experienced people in the company from whom one can learn. Also the company has many own resourced to be used. cons:The company is very slow and has out-fashioned management style. It is very frustrating at times. This company is not for people who wants things to happen fast.
2p3a7p,"pros:Uhhh, well if you're lucky enough to really not care about your job, you're easy going and can blend into the woodwork, you might be able to come in, keep your head down and just be left alone. cons:Anecdote: Upper management recognizes benefits of morale. Middle management then tasked with setting standard to measure morale - employees caring enough about the company to submit their own ideas for ""continuous improvements"" (CI's). Lower management is tasked with achieving measurable morale in the form of the volume of CI's - two a month. Bottom management puts a gun to each employee's head and tells them they'd better turn in 2 CI's a month or it'll go in their next performance review making them vulnerable the next time they have layoffs. Employees reluctantly turn in any CI's that'll give them two a month, including things like ""found pen on floor, picked it up"". Upper management sees numbers and thinks morale goals have been met, avalanche of mostly-worthless CI's waste several people's time, and employee morale couldn't be worse. This pretty much sums up everything Honeywell does.Safety: Safety SEEMS to be a MAJOR concern for Honeywell! ... unless it's too inconvenient or expensive, then hell with ya. HSE's goal is not to keep the employees safe, but to reduce Honeywell's liability.Pay: Rates have been frozen for well over a decade. After 8 years I was still making only 76% of the industry's standard for STARTING pay in the same job.People: Most co-workers are hard-working and friendly people. Team Leads are too often unqualified simpletons with too much liability and not enough authority. Supervisors stay in their offices and don't want to be bothered with any of that work-related stuff. Upper management are usually polite but clueless. They set impossible standards based on BS numbers and the production floor creates more BS to look like they achieved it.Advancement: None. Seriously, not a chance in hell.I have never in my life worked for a company that has so perfectly represented the stereotypes of corporate bureaucracy. I don't know of anyone who works there that wants to, but they're the biggest employer in the area."

1t3p1y,"pros:Nice people to work with mostly cons:Brown-nosing works too well, onsite cafeteria terrible, terrible decisions made with outsourcing"
6p6f2b,"pros:Good place to learn. Decent pay and benefits although they are declining. cons:The personal touch at Honeywell Aerospace is gone and employees are a number rather than an asset. In 2016 we have taken pay cuts and unpaid furlough week off every quarter. As people leave they do not back fill and we have had 2 layoffs in the 1st 3 quarters of the year while the stocks do great and leadership gets their bonuses. The company continually cuts project and site funding needed to improve quality on rejected hardware or meet customer investigation commitments.Those of us left are expected to do more with less and cover the job responsibilities of those that have left or been laid off. Years ago, this was a great place to work, but not anymore. We are losing many talented people as they choose to seek employment elsewhere due to all of the changes and cuts."
0o3w6g,pros:lots of opportunity for growth. cons:had a manager that micromanaged
0x5u0y,"pros:Pay, people,hours and no uniforms. cons:Management is horrible, benefits used to be good really high deductible now. Reviews really bad supervisors put no effort into knowing employees even less effort into reviews. Only thing they care about are shareholders. They spend no money on updating equipment but they love wasting money on furniture and trying to impress auditors by stopping production to move things and clean. Mandatory overtime due to rifs and alot of lost talent due to furloughs."

7c9m7z,"pros:This is a remarkable organization to work for. Provided your vision is upward mobility, there are no limits on career building within the Honeywell Operating System. Whether you are a scientist or a specialist in IT, or perhaps you have achieved experience in Human Resources, Marketing, Law, there is a place for you at Honeywell. cons:Because of the volatility of the marketplace it is misguided to identify ""Cons"" concerning the Honeywell Corporation. I would like to see a review of the research interests at UOP and a reshuffling to the ""deck""/"
9v1n9n,pros:Very profitable and growing company which hires only the best talent cons:Too many changes in the IT organization and morale generally average to poor
2j1g4h,"pros:There is ample challenging work to do if you are self motivated. They have a wide portfolio of products so you can find your niche. cons:There are too many managers, which can result in loss of productivity due to the bureaucracy involved. The health care benefits have been progressively worsening."
0b7e5z,pros:Great advancement opportunities if you want cons:No family life balance to spend more time with family
9r4d4s,"pros:Great pay for the job I do as well as enough vacation/sick then the average worker. cons:Rules, departments jobs seem to change every month. Once you learn something that is no longer valid. For the size company it is the health benefits are terrible."
5c3q6g,"pros:The Honeywell name has become synonymous with innovative technologies and materials. The have hundreds of facilities all over the world and have completed several acquisitions to further diversify. cons:Where should I start? I've been with this company for 14 years. I watched as former CEO Dave Cote completed several acquisitions, only to then watch the company ""spin off"" two divisions into new companies that now struggle.Attracting and retaining talent in an unknown concept. If you are negotiating your salary as a prospective employee, you better aim high because you're going to make that exact salary for most of your career. The employee evaluation system sets unrealistic goals to prevent pay raises.Perhaps the most damaging thing I've seen is CEO Dave Cote's ""Honeywell Operating System"" or HOS. It's his personal attempt to mimic the Toyota Operating System, a very time consuming and wasteful program was put in place. At my facility, 2-3 new manager positions were created just to oversee HOS. Production lagged and ultimately suffered."
0u6w9i,"pros:Lots of work, challenging projects. Some good people here cons:Extremely low pay. Engineers are leaving in droves and Senior management isn't doing anything about it. They've been saying ""we're working on it"" for over a year now. They have a ridiculous overtime policy, you have to work an extra 5 hours per week for FREE before you even start to earn overtime, then it's just straight pay. Annual raises don't keep up with inflation or medical increases. Even with a promotion you are still slowly loosing money by working here. Last year I only got 2.6 percent. Just got a promotion and it was only 2% increase, but I'm managing nearly 30 projects!We are all overworked too. Many good engineers are leaving and we have to keep taking on extra work loads. Meanwhile they can't get new people in because they wont offer enough to attract anyone good."
9f9j6e,"pros:Prototype of wrongly working corporation. Promotions based on Dilbert principle. What is written is not followed. Exaggerated bureaucracy. Internal processes consuming 80% of working time => resulting in extreme work load on some positions. cons:Ironically, lack of proper management gives sufficient space for freedom and realization"

3k0e4v,"pros:Stock growth. There is not much more to say but even that is tanking. cons:So much to say here. Honeywell wants to become a first class software company. Having worked for a couple of Silicon Valley startups, Honeywell is out of their league. They need to hire a leader who understands agility in order to be competitive in the future. The inability to make decisions, along with their complete disrespect for employees shows to me that Honeywell is destined to continue to fail. Lack of innovation outside of aviation is disheartening. Peeling back benefits, the move to an annual 401K match <-- big deal to us! Honeywell has basically taken money out of our retirement plans and disguised it as ""a way to reward employees"" is essentially a way to rape us of our benefits. We all know they will do their RIF's in December. So, we not only lose those gains over the course of the year - we lose the entire match on Honeywell's whim.I left my Silicon Valley startup to try and help HON grow, man I've tried but it's a lost cause. Everyone on my team is looking for new opportunities outside of Honeywell, as am I. I'm done."

1k0z4u,"pros:Pros are hard to list - there are many good people there, very bright, but management has the picture that anyone can be replaced at any time - and this is just not true. Experience and loyalty are not valued enough regardless of the return to the company they've generated. The picture is that every position can be replaced by a cheaper worker globally and they are constantly pursuing that goal. They have no loyalty to America or it's workers. cons:Well - pretty much everything. Management is where it starts and management is where it ends. It's pathetic."

4c0j2g,"pros:Far reaching depth of products means many opportunities at numerous global locations. Stock price at all time high due to constant focus on cost cutting. cons:The cost cutting has gone deep. The impact on employees has been significant. Over the past 10 years there have been pay cuts (then restored), half the years with no merit increases, reduction in 401k match, 3 furloughs in 2 years, pension plan cuts (wages capped for those that had legacy pension plan, new employee pensions small), and remote working completely eliminated."

0a1j3f,"pros:Good local coworkers, commiserate together cons:Mobile is a terrible city to live. Corporate management live their lives for shareholders and stock market. Sold their souls to money. Put less qualified people in upper management that have no idea what the business or the culture is about. Work the employees to the bone with decreased pay and limited overtime but yet when corporate is asked for more positions it is declined. Looking to unionize."
6o6t5t,pros:Extended training program. Saw all aspects of the AIDC Industry. cons:No vertical movement. Hired under false pretenses. Over sold and under delivered.

3s5x6r,"pros:Honeywell stock has risen significantly over the years. It is a very large company that has given me steady employment for 10+ years. Some parts of the business seem to have a very good culture and rewards, others not so much. cons:Not thrilled with treatment of employees, and the culture shift that appears to be happening. Top down control with lots of short term thinking (make the numbers). My department has had a high rate of attrition and low morale."

And a great stepping stone. Use them as they use you. cons:Below market target on salary offerings. Healthcare and assessment process is totalitarian. Benefits have been scaled back, while we are told to our face that shareholders are more important. Company surveys are a joke. The obvious bad results (i.e.: benefit) gets skimmed over by top management, while they focus on the minuscule as change goals. Lots of managers from GE, still old philosophy of ridding of top and bottom 10% by an antiquated 9-block system, which results a high turnover rate."
5t4g5y,"pros:New & rewarding work on tech development projects that produce systems & software products that enhance automation, usability and safety of avionics systems deployed for commercial & business aircraft. cons:Support of metrics collection on progress towards milestones and repetitive quoting of project costs steals engineering time that should be applied to quality systems development, integration & testing as well as work on patents."

2h8f2a,"pros:The stock price has gone up. Seems to be a good place to work if you are in Sales or Marketing and have access to a spouse's health insurance benefits. cons:There is a decided effort to shift engineering jobs to ""emerging regions"", which is management speak for ""low cost"". As engineers have quit, their positions get shifted to China or India. It doesn't matter that the foreign engineers are less than half as capable!This, along with cutting out Vision Insurance last year, Dental Insurance this year, and no raises in 2 of the last 4 years make this a miserable place to work. In the last 5 years they've eliminated the pension for new employees, reduced the 401k match for everyone, and ruined the benefits to the point where it's almost cheaper to get un-subsidized insurance through the exchange.Lastly, the culture is very much ""do as I say, not as I do"". I've had someone from management question me over the ethics of taking a USB Flash drive as a gift from a vendor, and then have the same person accept multiple smart watches from another vendor."

9d4r4t,"pros:For the most part, working level folks (especially technical) are great -- very smart and dedicated to making top quality products. cons:Management (business and corporate) has lost sight of what employees value, and continues to diminish the non-monetary reason for staying. Recent emphasis on software is fine, but many high-value Aerospace products are mechanical."
3g5f5x,"pros:Honeywell makes a wide range of significant components for everything that flies. The technical challenges can be very interesting and some of Honeywell's solutions are unique and successful. cons:Recent executive changes foretell major strategic changes in many of the company's product lines. The company has 25,000 engineers, scientists, and technicians, 60% of whom don't write software. It's unlikely that a company that constantly reminds it's employees that it is a software company is going to keep those smart engineers much longer. Technical expertise is no longer valued by the top three-four layers of good old boy executives. The technical career path exists on paper. No one knows what the requirements are to climb the last two-three steps."

5s2e7u,"pros:You get to work with a diverse group of engineers from all over the world designing a variety of flight safety and other avionics products. Other divisions cover building controls and specialty materials. cons:With the push to move the bulk of the design work to ""global"" (i.e. low cost) sites, domestic engineers become more project managers than designers. The ""process"" overhead can also be overwhelming at times."

No work-life balance, can't work from home and expected to work 24/7. Routinely micro-managed with no empowerment to make decisions and nearly all decisions must be approved at the very top. Turnover is absurdly high, with longevity measured in months and not years of service."

9k1x5b,"pros:In my role (earlier than 2012) I had lots of variety and the ability to take on as much responsibility as I wanted. The overall culture was draconian and very much ""good old boys club"" but in the area where I worked and my job allowed me to, for the most part, ignore that and get my work done. cons:That meant ignoring a screaming, lunatic of a boss (there were far too many but I rarely saw mine), her assistant who broke down in tears 1-3 times each week, the numerous extra-marital affairs with VPs and promotion by cleavage. HR's job was to fire anyone who was a whistle blower or in any way disagreed with management. Senior managers were great (the ones I knew all left), mediocre and a bit crazy, the latter two ""styles"" fared the best."

Honeywell has a fabulous CEO, Dave Cote, who has vision and tremendous business sense. cons:The industry, and Honeywell's, move to higher deductible health care plans has made it difficult for many singles and families."
8l0b3s,pros:Defense and aerospace provide continuous contracts. The company has massive resources to weather downturns. It is a good place to hide if you are an average/below average employee. cons:Frequent furloughs. The stock price is high at the expense of employee income (furloughs) and long hours. Ratings are somewhat based on if you are in the right clique.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing and if often to beneficial to people who do join as there is a knowledge to be gained. However, the issue is there tends to be a lot of ""bashing"" of the younger generations across the organization. This isn't a huge concern in of itself and is often misplaced.The real issues with this organization have been a lot of the leadership's decisions to become more ""efficient"". A lot of cutting has happened to employee benefits and there has been non stop quarterly layoffs in recent years. A lot of this is blamed on the industry not being strong but also a ton of it has been decided by gross over-reaction to stock pricing."

Continually in a cost reduction mode, furloughs, merit increases, regular RIFs. A lot of highly political management afraid for their jobs. Only want to hear good news. If you disagree with anything, watch out. Honeywell is not unique here as most Fortune 500 companies fit this same mold."
1h1q6m,pros:1. Great technology and experience to gain from2. Flexibility cons:1. Too many hours required to put in to get good results2. Teams are spread worldwide. You get flexibility but your workday has no set schedule and end - start your day at 5 am and go on till midnight3. A lot of micromanagers around4. Employee with aggression and tendency to yell in meetings move up fast5. Too many processes and everything is focused on revenue.

2g8e2m,"pros:Been at Honeywell/AlliedSignal/Garret/AiResearch for almost 40 years. I've been privileged to work with some of the brightest, most talented people I've ever met. The work is very challenging, which tends to bring out the best in us. The culture is collaborative, and the projects are team oriented, and all are encouraged to bring the best they have to the job. Compensation is performance based. There is opportunity for growth and advancement, created by the development of new products, as well as attrition due to age demographics. New management at the top is extremely growth oriented and supports bold initiative and new ideas. cons:Ongoing benefits erosion, arguably, or not, consistent with the rest of the industry."
8u5w9q,"pros:Huge company with many, diverse roles in a wide variety of locations. Access to large amounts of capital for big investments. cons:Huge bureaucracy focused on what seems to exclusively quarterly gains at all costs.Lots of outsourcing. If you're role can have a procedure written up for it, better bet they are going to do anything in their power for an H1b visa to take it over or ship it off to India.Paltry cost of living raises that don't even keep up with inflation, even for top performers. There is no secret about this.Insurance is ridiculous. Expensive with a $5000 deductible. In fact, all of the benefits are pretty sub Paar as well as being taken away.Very little concern for long term growth. They will cut out crucial infrastructure without a thought if its not being utilizes immediately in a measurable way. Guess what - having engineers do their own IT work doesn't make financial sense. You're switching from a guy making 20$/hr to one making 40$/hr. Which would matter if you didn't rely on the ability to drive workers into overtime for free.Expectation to work overtime is inherent. Honeywells' business model involves reduction of ancillary support positions like IT and HR, and attempting to standardize and automate everything. What really ends up happening is people who specialize and excel at certain fields (engineers for example) end up having to do a lot of other work not related to their field so are A) very inefficient and B) distracted from the real value producing role which ultimately ends up costing the company more money in the long run. The reason corporations are now switching to this mentality is that extra cost is now hidden in the extra hours the employee will inevitably have to work to do both his job and the ancillary roles. If you're on salary then it actually does save them money at the cost of your life. Land of the Free"

8y6t1h,"pros:Large company with a wealth of resources cons:Working for or with Honeywell is a detriment to your health. Honeywell makes its money on acquisitions - they buy up profitable companies, consolidate and outsource jobs, steal their technologies, move to the next company and repeat...They report a profitable bottom line from the acquisitions, but internally they are cutting benefits, scrutinizing every minute expense, shutting down facilities and laying off employees.Honeywell absolutely does not care about its employees. They do not promote anyone to a manager without a Bachelors degree and director level promotions require a Masters degree. It's an unwritten rule, but they write their job descriptions to rule out people they don't want. As a result, employees with tenure from acquired companies are often overlooked and discarded. Employees are expected to work long hours, with unrealistic expectations/metrics, and are stressed to the max because of the workloads and demands. These expectations are not limited to their employees, but also to vendors that work for them and want their business. If you're looking for work-life balance, this is NOT the company for you."

If your manager coaches you well, you can climb the corporate ladder really fast. cons:Not much interest in employee retention. Performance reviews are solely based on external feedback. Manager has very little role to play in employee's performance and motivation. They are least concerned. They do not try to find time to speak with employees if they receive negative feedback. They do not bother to check if they feedback presents only one face of the coin. Other than the performance reviews, most processes are fairly organized."

Lots of perks and attention to the business functions, but none given to engineering except for pats on the back when things go well. Tiny raises in good years, zero raises in times of economic uncertainty (so guess how often that happens). Very little opportunity for advancement. Benefits, specifically health care, are terrible. Health care has very high premiums and is a high deductible plan - it's supposed to be one or the other. The message we hear every day is that the stockholders are the only people who matter - this results in a short-term perspective that is all about stock price today."

Vision and dental insurance not subsidized. Medical benefit is high deductible to the nth degree. Honeywell is a self insured company = benefit as a profit center for the company.Work from home policy is gone. Yet people are asked to attend mtgs before and after normal hours.

Employees are viewed as disposable, Seasoned subject matter experts are leaving the company but instead of acknowledging this as regrettable turnover, it is shrugged off as oh well just hire someone younger for less money. HR is staffed by by 20 & 30 year old inexperienced pawns. That think posting positive reviews are fooling anyone."
9x4l7p,pros:A huge company which gives you access to multiple levels of a B2B value chain. Many Options to switch from one business to another. Strategic Marketing drives decision making. cons:The HR function is completely superseded by the line management! Line managers are often promoted salesman and not specialists.

Raises didn't even keep up with insurance hikes. 401k lost an annual %5. Was taking home $200 less per check four years after started due to benefits hikes. $3000 deductible per person in household. That means if you have three people in your family you are out $9000 before it covers an aspirin. No advancement. No professionalism. Have to go through a 6 month background investigation.

0i6s6w,pros:Large company with a wide variety of opportunities. Great and knowledgeable people and their product line puts them above their competition. cons:Sometimes too large of a company is hard to stand out. Need to continue to network and work on projects outside your own area.
9q8n4m,"pros:The people are the best asset, a lot of long time, knowledgeable employees and new employees. Flexible time schedule depending on your manager. cons:A lot of talent that is overlooked to save money and it ends up costing the employees more to fix (time and money).

2y4s5c,"pros:Many opportunities in the company for aggressive, hard workers who don't care about work/life balance. Compensation is usually good, although benefits are not competitive. cons:Management has no idea how to solve the business problems - they are only interested in finding someone to blame. When having a tough quarter, expect leadership to impose an unpaid furlough on employees to save money. ""Employees are our most important asset"" is lip service only - in actuality, employees are viewed as disposable, so they can be replaced with an H1-B from India. Healthcare benefits are much more expensive than other employers, to encourage employees to go on their spouse's employer's health insurance."
7d2a4i,"pros:Good company to make your resume shine, cons:TOO BIG OF A COMPANY TO CARE ABOUT EMPLOYEES"
8i7l2j,"pros:Given the size of the company, there are a lot of opportunities to grow. Honeywell places a lot of emphasis in Product Marketing as the driver for growth. It is a great place to work as a Product Manager where you can use the systems in place and tools available to set, drive, and implement growth strategies in wide variety of markets. cons:The company, specifically the Sensing and Controls division, is fairly risk averse. Given the size of the company and the tendency to be risk averse, you can find the implantation of the projects to be slower than a smaller, more nimble company. My advise is to backup all initiatives and ideas you might have with data and a cost/benefit analysis to gain the support of management and get your projects funded."

Layoffs are too common and furloughs are required depending on status of Aerospace finances."
7l4z9t,pros:Large company to work For cons:Lack of strong management. Senior Leadership has lost touch with the employee base. The only driver now is shareholder value. This value proposition is coming at the expense of employees.

8r7y4s,"pros:World class co-workers working on some of the most innovative technology in the Aerospace industry. Good base pay. Industry-leading initiatives in production productivity and marketing activity. cons:The benefits are awful and keep getting worse. Honeywell pioneered medical testing for its entire employee base annually. We have only sky high deductible plans for medical and nothing special in any other areas.Honeywell Aerospace has had multiple years with no raises and multiple furloughs and layoffs since I joined a few years ago. Many positions have relocated to low-cost regions. I have never felt like my job is secure at this company.The site facilities are awful, the cafeterias have awful food with no options and they close early for every meal. There is no on-site IT support for computer or printer issues. I can't even use the garbage can in my cube for food waste because they don't pick up garbage every night so all food waste has to go in the central garbage.They have no consideration for quality of life or work / life balance. Telecommuting regularly is no longer allowed. Health or child care facilities are not available on-site. The only common space is the cafeteria, so socializing is difficult. They have even eliminated annual barbeques, Christmas parties, etc. This place is just soul sucking and no fun."
2a7t8p,"pros:Absolutely none. This company continues to bleed their employees and give obscene bonuses to upper management. Latest news is a 10% reduction in pay for engineers with no set end date. Sent out the email reducing salary and 4 hours later announced $18 million in bonuses to top 4 executives. cons:They expect you to work a minimum of 44 hours with no additional compensation with most managers ""encouraging"" a minimum of 50. No raises for 3 years, furlough twice, no incentives for hard work. No upward mobility unless you are on the inside track and are a yes man."

8i0s4z,pros:Decent pay if you work in defense and relaxed on the defense side. They give you some leeway for showing up on time. There are refrigerators in the break room. cons:Assume you will go to space where the engineers blame you for everything. They are to lazy to give you a process you can build too. Everyone is spying on each other and the management there takes he said she said literally. The entire company is laying off all the time that's why I am looking to jump careers.

8p2d7a,"pros:Strong company name. Good benefit package for employees. cons:Management too hung up on ""meeting roll down goals"" to actually lead. ""Walk the Talk gentlemen""!! Employees need actual motivation other than artificial goals created at review time to pat ones-self on the back. Actual raises would of gone a long way and the message ""Well folks, we just didn't meet our BS goals so no raises for below management level raise. Then why doesn't UPPER management take the hit also??"

9q0y9e,pros:Great Benefits Package and job experience. cons:Current challenge is job security due to restructuring
1d6o0t,"pros:Traveled for work. Team members were awesome. Couple of great bosses out of 22 years of service. MBA degree paid, worked from home. cons:Managed to make it through MULTIPLE layoffs/RIFs (Reduction in Force) over my 22 years there. Focus is on making the numbers and Wall Street's reactions as well as which company they can next acquire. Benefits are so so. This is such a big company that they can't do more than industry standards. Lots of jobs moved to Mexico, or if not moved then just filled in Mexico to begin with. Pay was not that great - even with MBA took many many years to work up salary ladder"
0d4z3z,"pros:As an account manager I spend all my time in the field. I have freedom to set my schedule an operate with minimal oversight. As long as my contractors were helping produce, everything is fine! cons:It is a fee for service contract based work. state regulators over electricity providers have to approve. It is a long drawn out process."

0e9x1t,"pros:Exciting work environment, decent pay, but it's certainly way lower for aerospace standard industry pay. Opportunities for advancement are plenty. cons:Management is slow and seems to undervalue it's employees. I've seen a lot of engineers leave in my time, and I've heard of many not being properly evaluated. Pay needs to be on par with aerospace industry, not just standard for Honeywell."

2t0n0j,"pros:Stable company, ok pay and benefits cons:Quite a few times, I heard the phrase your paycheck is your reward. Overall, pretty much not friendly to their employees. There is very little if any rewards you can give your employees or get yourself.Management lacks leadership skills and is antagonistic towards workers, making middle management a quick path to failure if you want to take care of your folks. Managers, not leaders, not dynamic, not friendly.What pretty much is the acme of Honeywell is SQDIC (safety, quality, delivery, inventory, cost) has no reference to people. Pretty sad."

7s8g6r,"pros:exciting place to work, very fast pace, lots of change, good people in the trenches. cons:Corporate management only has 30-day patience for results.

3u7i5p,pros:None that come to mind. cons:They don't value their employees. Poor benefits and they get worse every year. Implement new policies that negatively impact the employee. Seems like the CEO just wants to cater to the investors at the expense of the employee.Also with such a large corporate environment everything takes 5x longer than it should to get things done and there are too many layers of management for anyone that is not a Sr Manager or Director to have any impact on change.

6z4a6a,"pros:Great work/life balance. Good people to work with & for. cons:Decisions made on the corporate level favor the Honeywell shareholder much more than the salaried employee and are by no means consistent. Salaries have just been temporarily reduced by 10%. Lay offs of supervisors that were just set up in the supervisory position less than a year ago. Notification of these decisions are typically by emails about difficult economic headwinds and the reductions absolutely necessary. Honeywell stock price continues on the rise, however."

9x7l7a,"pros:Many of the managers I have worked with are very helpful and care about you as an individual. There are always projects to be worked. cons:Upper management does not care about employees.

6r5a5i,"pros:Has diversity at the upper layers of management. A good company to grow and gain knowledge. Most people helpful, smart and level headed cons:There a quite a few individuals now at the directors level who I do not think deserve to be there and in all likelihood there to fulfill a quota requirement...which is sad as they still need to mature in their roles before being put in a position to manage a team of such a great width and depth."
8r2r9i,"pros:Excellent group of professionals making technology happen. Nice people. Great respectful culture. Cutting edge aerospace technologies. Best in its class. cons:Health insurance is expensive, currently I don't think the company covers any percentage on the premium for its employees.

Generally people are nice day to day. cons:Health benefits are horrible, dont plan on having a child on this policy. Little to no bonus depending on your position.

4s6g3u,"pros:Only a steady paycheck, but there are better places to look. cons:In recent few years, instead of being the Engineering company, Honeywell has focused too much on manipulating the short term Stock price and and how the upper executives can get their cut.Cuts, cuts, and more cuts to our 401K contributions, Health Care, Pensions, even to internal spending such as routine maint and support of the Printer/copiers that we need and use daily.The upper mgmt and executives received Bonuses early this year but decided not to give raises to the Engineers and lower echelon employees."

The unlimited vacation is a joke, you get crucified for taking too many days off. There's fear in this new culture that if you are an underperformer you will not have a project to work on and you will be let go. It's also top heavy, too many people managing projects and not enough people doing real work. Management demand is also unrealistic, they push you to deliver the products but won't give you resources or time to complete it. The benefit package (medical, dental, vision) is nothing to brag about, you pay a lot for a family plan although the company is self-insured. There's also no remote work policy."

But that's pretty much the only positive left, and people are leaving in staggering numbers. cons:Pressure to make each quarter is extreme and financials are engineered to do so. Lack of any revenue growth has led the company to improve its profits by squeezing the employee base among other edge-of-ethics actions. Abusive work culture driven from the very top with people leaving in droves. Management banned remote work globally in late 2016, punishing the entire workforce because a tiny sliver of the organization was abusing work-from-home privileges. Horrible medical benefits - a family can expect to pay more than $10k per year in premiums and medical costs. Punitive medical screening policy essentially forces employees to undergo annual medical testing or pay a $1,500 penalty per adult on the policy. It's just sad to see what this once-great company has become."

1m5o5v,pros:Great team of people doing the actual work. cons:Benefits keep getting worst year over year. Constant threat of your job being outsources and new furloughs. The company is trying to get employees to believe working for Honeywell is a privilege and one of the company benefits. The constant reorganization has left managers unsure what their roles are. In over 40 years of work experience I have never seen a company with global moral as low as Honeywell.

2m4t3m,"pros:Design is new for Honeywell (the CEO made a statement about wanting Honeywell to be 'the Apple of Industrials' so there is a lot to do there. Honeywell essentially buys smaller companies and lets them run, so as a designer you can step in and help them build better products and experiences. cons:The industrial design management is horrific and created a toxic work environment. ID management's style is essentially a bat about the head and neck. ID management uses verbal abuse as the primary management tool, followed up by tirades and berating language. ID management lies about what is expected from you, making things like deliverables change from day to day. ID management has unrealistic and hidden expectations about how design and designers should work, and uses that against the designers. ID management takes no responsibility for anything as far as I could tell.Here is an example: I met ID management at one of the Honeywell subsidiaries in the suburbs of a major midwestern city for a kick off meeting around designing new fire control systems. This is a typical product development meeting, where the designers meet with engineers to understand technical limitations (manufacturing electronics etc) and meet with product management, who own the business side of the products (what it needs to do, and cost and who its for). These meetings are what they sound like, a kick off- a chance to meet your product development partners and get on the same page. Designers typically leave these meetings and put plans to gather for the project; schedule, process resources etc.I walked into this facility and ID management pulled me aside immediately into an empty office and began dressing me down about why I had not brought a presentation to show these people. I was horrified that I had missed this assignment and had no idea what ID management was referring to- it was a kick off meeting, we were there to learn. Then it became apparent this was one more wacky mind game. As I caught myself I realized no one even asked me if I had a presentation, ID management just laid into me for NOT having a presentation.That is the type of mind games I constantly endured at Honeywell, and the type of behavior Honeywell believes makes them successful. As a designer please stay away. It is a stifling and crushing creative environment. ID management is doing nothing that remotely looks like it's heading Honeywell toward the 'Apple of the Industrials'.In short its the worst job I have EVER had in my life. And I have had some lame jobs."
8z1z0x,"pros:PMs have ultimate control, often prohibiting others from doing the right thing on projects cons:Some of the worst health benefits I've ever seen. Mandatory biometric screening each fall to prove you don't smoke, aren't obese, etc. or you incur $$"

6n2x3y,"pros:I've never had a ""corporate"" job before so I was worried that I wouldn't assimilate, but thanks to some great people, supportive managers & some fun projects I can safely say I made the right decision. Those things aside there are a number of other things that make me happy with my move: lateral/upward mobility is one - the company thrives on moving talent across business units; allowing employees to stay engaged and interested. Location is another, the Morris Plains location is beautiful and really makes coming to work everyday easy. Also, upper management gets it, they seem to be making the right moves to pull in & keep talent and to move the company in the right direction. cons:Honeywell is still growing out of ""old"" corporate culture. There are times when you're working on something that should seemingly be easy, but you're hit with a roadblock that may take longer than you may be used to due to un-necessarily complex processes and/or a long approval chain. That seems to be heading the way of the dinosaur though - in my brief time here so far, it's already gotten better."

Fun and diverse projects to work on. cons:Layoffs, furloughs, no more working from home, terrible management decisions, no pay raises for several consecutive years. It's clear that the company management only cares about profits and stock price. Employees are treated as expendable. The company is selling less and less products, and forcing the employees to make up the difference with furloughs, layoffs, and paycuts. Meanwhile, the leadership team still rewards itself with million dollar bonuses."
1b9b7d,pros:The companies relocation package is very convenient. Also they did provide some aid during Harvey cons:The benefits are mediocre at best. Also travel is a no go here. Investors are the only priority.
8b3r9v,pros:Good benefits. Horizontal colleagues are very friendly and professional. cons:Upward mobility is nonexistent. Advancing with degrees and certification pose a high risk of micromanagement and eventual job loss. Be prepared to search for a new position if you over-qualify for your role.
5b6i4q,pros:1. Great technology and experience to gain from2. Flexibility cons:1. Too many hours required to put in to get good results2. Teams are spread worldwide. You get flexibility but your workday has no set schedule and end - start your day at 5 am and go on till midnight3. A lot of micromanagers around4. Employee with aggression and tendency to yell in meetings move up fast5. Too many processes and everything is focused on revenue. More time is spent on project planning and revenue review than actual execution6. Decent compensation but poor benefits

4h0r4b,"pros:Ability to work from home, although that was strongly discouraged, stock more than doubled in 5 years. cons:Direct manager a micro-manager (at times) then completely hands-off (other situations). Manager and director in my work team took no responsibility for projects going sideways and set unrealistic targets for project completion. Manager and director for the work group would NEVER learn from past mistakes and would continue to repeat past performance but, somehow, expect different results."
3f2a0p,"pros:Great place to apply technical skills, sharpen business acumen, and no shortage of opportunity to take on new challenges if you are hard working and willing to leave your comfort zone. cons:Developed region working environment facing constant pressure to downsize and diminishing value proposition for individual contributors who see declining benefits over time."
2e3c7d,"pros:Work/life balance as a young engineer has been great. Many talented, motivated coworkers with years of experience to draw from. cons:Frustrating, overly-cautious business strategy. Complete unwillingness to spend company money even when all signs including voice of customer point to strong demand. Minimal R&D funding; prone to cuts if fiscal targets are in jeopardy. The company is hyperfocused on quarterly and yearly financial targets and neglects the mid- to long-term. Aerospace division lives and dies by contracts - major impact from recent downturn in demand for the products offered by Honeywell Aero."

4g2w3u,"pros:Good health insurance plan and and other benefits, and opportunity to work on amazing products (Honeywell Aerospace). You get the opportunity to work with great and smart people. cons:Work/life balance can be poor sometimes. Pay can become low for senior employees, theres is not a lot work flexibility you will expect when are an exempt employee."
1r8l8a,pros:Average pay...safe environment...its a job..not a career. cons:Eroding benifits for employees. Antaginistic environment for employees. High attrision and no back filling leaves an overworked negative enviroment. Employees are running to leave.
2g6c9f,"pros:Honeywell provides a great Work-life flexible schedule cons:If you do not have a degree in Engineering, it's VERY hard to grow your career."
7g6e6h,pros:Challenging work which motivates you to work harder and enjoy the work. cons:A few furloughs last year.
1z8o7m,pros:Great company that treats its employees well cons:They do not utilize there ERP system to near it's full potential. Overtime could be cut by 50% plus
3s7u8n,pros:the people are great to work with cons:too much out sourcing to China
7l6u2v,"pros:A lot of very smart people. cons:Back stabbing, dishonest people who are cut throat. They work in silo's and care nothing about their people, it's all a facade. HR is horrible and upper management is demanding to the point that you have no quality of life and the pay is below scale."
7q2c5z,"pros:Good benefits, great teamwork, flexible employer. cons:Not all organizations align to the same goals. This creates issues when trying to implement projects."

6l0l5y,"pros:Flexible work weeks and schedules. 9/80. Clean, safe environment. Lots of great innovative talent and people. New and changing technology. Great place to ...START! And a great stepping stone. Use them as they use you. cons:Below market target on salary offerings. Healthcare and assessment process is totalitarian. Benefits have been scaled back, while we are told to our face that shareholders are more important. Company surveys are a joke. The obvious bad results (i.e.: benefit) gets skimmed over by top management, while they focus on the minuscule as change goals. Lots of managers from GE, still old philosophy of ridding of top and bottom 10% by an antiquated 9-block system, which results a high turnover rate."
9g9q8d,"pros:Some flexibility in work hours. But that depends on who you are. I do like the people that I work with. I would be very happy to work with any of them somewhere else. cons:The culture is very unproductive and very discouraging. We are managed by people who have no connection to the product or to the customer, and that seems to be intentional. Management is especially detached from the people who actually do the work. Management listens only to themselves.I have worked in other places where we took pride in the product and our customer's satisfaction. This is not one of those places."
2z0e6q,pros:Direct management is top notch cons:upper level management is terrible
0p2l9r,"pros:I recently started with Honeywell, which is the fifth company for which I have worked. From the moment I walked in the door on day one, the employees, management, and company have been communicative and supportive in ensuring I have the best onboarding experience possible. All to-do's, scheduling, materials, and introductions were laid out clearly in front of the new hires and we were made to feel welcome from the beginning until now. I have not heard or seen any other company who does onboarding as well as Honeywell. cons:I will add feedback here if I find a con but, for now, it's been a fantastic experience in every way."
8s1x8t,"pros:Coworkers and salary (not benefits). Unlimited vacation if your manager agrees to let you take it. cons:Honeywell is running this company to the ground. Doesn't care about employees, constant layoffs, furloughs and hits to employee benefits. Any and all jobs are outsourced to countries like India, Mexico, Romania etc. You are a number and your skills mean nothing. Employees that are left, have to take on responsibilities of 3+ people. Moral has been at an all-time low for years. Shareholders run the business."
5y5c0u,"pros:Work from home, travel to. Other states for projects cons:Depends on who. You are reporting to some people think estimating is a joke"
3b9n9c,"pros:The industry I am involved with is doing well. YOY growth.Pay is competitive if you come from the outside. cons:Continue to furlough employee's regularly along with downsizing. Our revenue is increasing but we are not making unrealistic projections. This makes the company take short sighted approach to operations. Moving everything to China, Korea or Mexico. Exceedingly poor moral and inwardly focused activities."
1t4b6g,"pros:The company pays their employees very wellIf you like structure, Honeywell has their HOS (Honeywell Operating System) culture that they shove down your throat at every opportunity. It is so rigid that you have to carry a pamphlet with your daily/weekly duties with you everywhere you go and mark off what/when you performed the task so management can review it when they ask for it to make sure you're doing your job. cons:Benefits stink. High deductible insurance policy with HSA, 401K after 1 year of employment, very little time off for new employees.Company lacks the value of time management skills for their employees.Honeywell loves meetings. If something is going wrong, there's a meeting for that. If that's going wrong, need to have another meeting for that. They get so caught up in meetings that there is no time to actually work on what you're supposed to be doing to make sure things get accomplished/fixed.Management acts aggressively towards their employees and expects them to work 12 hour days and gives employees a difficult time if they don't come in ""early"" or stay ""late""."
1n6a9h,"pros:Stable, well-performing publicly owned company. CEO has done a good job maximizing the value to shareholders. Good benefits but costs now being passed on to employees. cons:Aerospace division suffers from glut of politically correct middle-managers with little talent and no vision, a functional matrix organization where no one is in charge but everyone can block progress, job deflation caused by export of real engineering work to 'high-growth' regions of the world, and hyper-focus on process improvement and project (micro) management over pragmatic engineering excellence to get results."
1k8x6g,pros:Interviews did not waist time with irrelevant questionsCorporate office supports collaborationExcellent on-boarding processColleagues are helpfulGood pay & benefits cons:Intranet is confusing and cumbersome
1l5p7z,"pros:Some flexibility depending on role in cons:Do not value their employees at all...furloughs, layoffs, no bonus structure, poor communication, no structure at all. There are many other companies out there, don't work here."
4m6s0i,pros:Supervisors are caring and very smart. I learned a lot from everyone I worked with. Great culture. cons:On-call shifts were my least favorite.
7z5a3m,"pros:Retirement benefits are best-in-class and PTO is excellent after a few years of service. (Note - health benefits are just average.) Good, capable workforce. Depending on the area you work in and the manager to whom you report, you may have flexibility to work a 4-day (10 hr days) workweek and/or telecommute. This is not practiced company-wide but does exist in some areas. cons:Too much focus on cost, at the expense of quality. There are many managers in the organization but few true leaders in this environment as most are too concerned about protecting their own position rather than taking some risks in doing what's needed to inspire and lead a team of professionals. Due to the intense focus on cost reduction, not much value or time is invested in growth of the domestic workforce. Too many reorgs and layoffs."
4m3h4t,pros:The work can be challenging in the right position. And there are chances for advancement in most divisions. Higher positions share in the bonus pool. cons:Senior management doesn't want to train for positions people are placed into which leads to the experienced workers covering for those with little to no knowledge. Senior management are engineers and lack business foresight which leads to furloughs and layoffs to make the quarter or year because of poor planning.
7l5q3x,pros:Good benefits and working environment. cons:Global exposure requires odd hours for meetings.
8w9t7g,"pros:They have a roof to keep the rain off of you. cons:When it comes to penny ante bs this company takes the cake. You can't just come in and do your job, they pick at the stupidest things. Wearing the proper straps isn't even enough, you have to wear it in a certain way even if works another way. I've always wore my strap on the ankle, now they are saying I might trip over it. I'M SITTING DOWN WHEN MY STRAP IS ON!!! I refuse to wear it on my wrist because the cord caught a board once and got knocked on the floor. They keep hiring temps, but we are slow. I'm so bored of coming in with very little to do. Why don't they give work to the people already here?"
5w6j4l,pros:Good company ethics & thoughts cons:More with less attitude and too many good people to make a struggling company look good.
7q7w9r,pros:Good environment Good installation good benefits cons:not development people stay on same positions for a long time
2r3p4i,"pros:Higher than average salaries with bonus potential. cons:Honeywell is constantly downsizing, so workload was always increasing without compensating for extra time. The stress of the constant rounds of furloughs and layoffs was demotivating, coupled with Honeywell's consistent poor performance in customer surveys when compared to competitors."
2k1h4a,pros:Good place to work and good management. cons:Can't think of any at this time.
6d0f2z,pros:Name brand recognition. Support staff. The people working here have so far been extremely helpful. Immense opportunities to grow professionally. Great benefits & pay. cons:I have not encountered any cons yet.
4m9k3i,"pros:Amazing patriatism from the Defense and Space group. You can tell there is a lot of pride in the products we develop for the military and space exploration. cons:Horrible corporate mentality. Profits are first, followed by hardware, followed by manager's bonuses, followed by investment on emerging markets. People are not viewed as an asset rather a commodity and a liability. No investment on education, training, benefits, or growth. Medical is a joke with no dental, and you have 0+ days of vacation, emphasis on the ""zero."""

1a0m7h,"pros:Honeywell had a flexible work schedule, telecommuting, interesting work, great mentors, diverse product portfolio, and lots of offices around the country to visit. cons:Leadership is aggressively cutting costs and not investing in the future. New programs often don't make it past the estimation process. VPD is not an agile process and doesn't seem to accelerate anything but waste."
2s7g0z,pros:Great for travel around world cons:Little to no upward movement. Slacking on annual pay merit increase
7b6z1a,pros:Exciting and challenging design projects. cons:Poor benefits relative to other technology companies and unable to retain young engineering talent.
3o5b4n,pros:Compensation is at industry standard. cons:Business outlook and the leadership reaction is creating a negative culture.
6d9o8l,pros:The work load is acceptable cons:No remote work is allowedHealth Insurance is lousy
6x8c2h,pros:Good pay and good team. Thats about it. cons:Terrible work life balance. Micro-managing. Horrible benefits. They will be lucky if the same planners are around in a year. Extremely short staffed even though we are considered fully staffed. Everyone is unhappy. Honeywell is known around Phoenix to work their employees to death from talking to people at other companies.
8a6i1w,"pros:Pay grade was matched from previous, but similar line of work. Peers were excellent to work with and very knowledgeable; a great resource for help when needed. Perks included vehicle, laptop, phone, office space. Management not on site (in this case, it was a good thing... also bad). cons:Immediate manager was out of touch with my job scope and my happenings in the field as he never spent time in the field (straight out of college, into engineering, and management). Other higher management seemed out of touch as well. Lack of customer service and support from management. Minimal mentoring. Benefits were not the greatest, but I have heard of worse."
2w2y2q,pros:Different businesses / strong financial performance cons:Silo attitude in businesses. Benefits reduced over the year
8d2n7t,pros:Lots of opportunities within the company. cons:Lots of competitive people in company
3s5h6r,"pros:Some matching of 401(k) from employees. cons:Constant reorganization that never settles, followed by yet another reorganization. Constant consolidation with newly acquired companies, causing constant chaos. Managers who only manage their own careers, and ongoing erosion of morale and benefits. Shareholders really should get some insight into this mess."
1e0t6d,pros:currently no pros that come to mind cons:reduced benefits in recent years
8g3b7m,"pros:Flexible work schedule. I am able to work from home whenever I need to, I choose my hours. Retirement contributions are pretty good (75% for the first 8%). If you want to take the train to work and save yourself some gas, they'll pay for a ticket. The people are great to work with. Merit-based rewards/raises. cons:Health insurance isn't so great (high deductible only, 3K deductible, 20% coinsurance after you hit the deductible). Benefits and opportunities seem to be decreasing, not increasing. Had layoffs this year plus a furlough."
1z7e0i,pros:Hires good engineers who develop excellent technology cons:Tends to hire and promote white males with Ivy league education. Benefits have been significantly reduced. Too many organizational and management changes. Systems and processes are designed to feed senior leadership with information and too much time is wasted in submitting this information. Tends to hire too may people in senior management roles with no one to do the work - need more worker bees rather than directors who make power point slides.
6f4i0q,"pros:Early hours, weekends free. cons:early hours, and long drives to the jobsite sometimes."
1j8r1u,"pros:401k match, stock is rising 2016-2017 cons:Health benefits suck, the company outsourcing anything it can"
3o4t3d,"pros:It's a job that provides a paycheck. Not much else. cons:No consistent metrics to be evaluated on.People in management have never done the job they are creating rules and processes for.It's a punishment system. One mistake wipes out virtually all of the positives you've contributed.Benefits are horrible.You don't matter to the company. All you are is an employee id number, not a person."

1m6z4i,pros:people are friendly and helpful cons:manager do not usually in office
7a9y9b,pros:Flextime is a nice perk cons:benefits are getting worse every year
5i6v3v,pros:Honeywell covers a large variety of industries which leads to an interesting mix of offerings. The (non executive) employees are hard-working and intelligent. Pay is decent. cons:The benefits are horrendous for such a large company that should have significant leverage. Benefits are cut year after year. Recently remote work was banned from the CEO level. Honeywell is trying to follow an Apple or Yahoo culture but seems to lack the understanding that global teams cannot meet locally the way local companies in San Fransisco are able to. This really shows a lack of fully understanding the problem before making knee-jerk sweeping changes that significantly affect so many employees. The worst part is that just a few months ago remote work and hiring remote talent was encouraged to increase the talent pool. What happens to those employees now? Clearly higher level leadership doesn't care. Lower level managers are left to pick up the pieces
7q7t0q,"pros:Had some excellent managers and coworkers cons:When people left the company, the positions were not filled for extended periods and existing employees had to do multiple jobs."
9a9q8a,"pros:While my time at Honeywell was limited, you can tell that employee development and career advancement was an important part of Honeywell-- from the SMART review system to the employee training/skills development programs--you could tell that it was an integral part of the company. They also offer and in some ways promote changing positions within the company through their internal job search system. cons:Unfortunately for me, the opportunities to continue to work at a great company was cut short due to their unwillingness to allow for remote work/telecommuting--even though many of the projects that I would manage would be at remote locations (e.g. - not in the home office) and spent most of my time communicating with people on the phone of via Lync around the world. In my humble opinion, this type of position could very well be conducted from almost anywhere, especially with current technological advancements."
4o6i4j,"pros:Opportunity to grow, ability to move into new positions and learn new skills. Strong company culture. Excellent office and good benefits (MP office) cons:Very high expectations to perform at standard. Lack of remote working is not keeping up with the trends of a software company. Change is constant. If you arent flexible this isnt the place for you."
4t2j3g,pros:Vacation package is great. Other than that there's no pros to this company. cons:Insurance is catastrophic. Be better if you were on government insurance. No time off other than vacation.
1p4j1j,"pros:Great team to work with. Excellent group at the local level. Potential for growth. Pretty good benefits. cons:Lack of job security. Manage for metrics in a very short-sighted way. Lack of foresight and impulsive, reactionary upper management is creating a growing list of problems. Current corporate management team seems to devalue all personnel other than direct production staff."
1u9h0v,pros:Great techs to work with. cons:Management never worked in the field.
8k4h0y,pros:Depends a lot on which division you work in but in general Honeywell has a great breadth and depth of opportunities which can lead to very interesting and challenging global projects for design engineers. cons:Many inefficiencies and gaps in processes/functions/capabilities across multi-national teams makes it hard to get things done and avoid disappointing customers.
1g6b2q,"pros:Learning new things every day, challenging work life, building teamwork throughout the company cons:There have been ups and downs with some of the management here. It is hard to get close and trust your management team when they aren't in the company for very long."
3k3t0g,"pros:Fast pace and dynamic company. Multi-tasking and have opportunity to learn. cons:Benefit is not as good, company should respect and reward employees when contribution is made."
4d5b5s,"pros:Challenging position with great people. Great teamwork. You see lots of businesses, especially if you are mobile and willing to relocate. cons:It can be very demanding. Work life balance is not always the best, Some of its offices are not exactly in the ideal locations"
3c1l5s,"pros:The individuals I work with are great. cons:No telecommuting--because the CEO's feelings were hurt one day. Bonuses cut in half. No raises. 3 furloughs already in 2016 with more to come. 2 RIFs. Active discrimination against older persons and women. On the work side, the work is not state of the art. Also many engineers do clerical work, not engineering work. Coding is old-fashioned without usage of newer techniques. You will spend hours on the phone at night and in the wee hours dealing with people in emerging nations whose work needs to constantly be fixed. Your sleep patterns will be against what the AMA advises. I have not been to a conference in over 20 years that I did not fund myself. Benefits are constantly eroded."
1j0o7h,pros:Decent pay. The executives think highly of themselves. Stock holders are King. Non US workforce is run with more employee goodwill. Good 401K match. Good place to get experience (and then leave) cons:Very spotty career paths with US workforce being constantly reduced. Severe lack of positive re-enforcement. Poor Job stability. Support workforce teams are highly disjointed which basically eliminates mentoring and team synergy. Constantly turn 10-20% of workforce per a systematic process built into their 9 block performance system. Poor and un-timely executive downward communication on what matters to employees. Vacation time off based solely on Managers prerogative. Benefits are constantly being watered down. Focused on getting out of manufacturing and moving all operations possible off-shore to low cost regions. Many international meetings and a work from home policy that does not work for this type of modern culture.
5n5j9h,"pros:Good standard benefit package (401k, Health/Med Plan, Life Insurance, Company matching), great people making part of great teams no matter what position you are in. Employee discounts, great innovative/helpful site management, higher paying than many other engineering opportunities in PR.Flexible work hours, good cafeterias in both PR sites. cons:Good engineers keep waiting to get noticed, promotions in Puerto Rico have become slow, almost halted across many teams even when they are going above and beyond their current roles for less than national average pay in a U.S. territory that just gets more expensive/exclusive. The educational assistance was a catch, in my case. Management made it look as if everyone gets a chance and that you can get started quick after a year with the company, but they have made it impossible for me to obtain approvals to continue studying in related fields (after more than 2 years) and in cases where I have had the opportunity to grow and learn from other design tools I have been slamed with a no for an answer in front of other peers. (Almost makes it feel like they really didn't want me to grow).Many employee discounts for PR are irrelevant or outdated to local stores and discounts available are less than half of those in U.S mainland... worst than that... company products offered to employees at a diacounted price are actually cheaper in Amazon for everyone to buy."
8v4g0m,pros:Honeywell seems very interested in business ethics and integrity. They value the employees and have programs in place for personal development. The benefits are competitive and allow for good financial options. cons:Benefits can always be better but the way Honeywell offers benefits does allow for some tax savings.
9e0d5w,"pros:Steady Job: pays just enough to live comfortably if you are a single person.9/80 schedule: Great way to add another day to your weekend.Work/Life balance: Not too badAverage 401k matching cons:Nearly everything:Pay: Below industry standard for all positions across the board.Benefits: Complete garbage, high monthly cost + high deductible. If you have a family, be prepared to pay 1000s.Corporate: 9 block diagram, great way to demoralize the already demoralized workforce.Work: its piling on yet people keep leaving the company so now 1 person is doing the work for 2-3 people. New projects are coming through the door.Organization: very disorganized, no one seems to be doing the duties of their particular job, everyone is jumping around doing someone else's.Career advancement: You have to submit your own essay if you want to advance to another level (which comes with a measly raise), almost not worth the title because now you will be responsible for more but at a barely higher salary.Cafeteria: completely overpriced, taking advantage of employees eat-onsite to charge them high prices for low quality food. Aramak is the server.Absolutely No benefits of being a government contractor. The president of the company repeats the same mantra every meeting, ""we need to become more efficient.""No Bonus"
4g9a6f,pros:Hardworking People that are dedicated. cons:Lack of diversity within the office.
0l4b3o,pros:Employees are great to work with. cons:Many furloughs = pay cuts for all. RIF reduction in force makes unhappy employees.

8b3e0a,"pros:Steady Job: pays just enough to live comfortably if you are a single person.9/80 schedule: Great way to add another day to your weekend.Work/Life balance: Not too badAverage 401k matching cons:Nearly everything:Pay: Below industry standard for all positions across the board.Benefits: Complete garbage, high monthly cost + high deductible. If you have a family, be prepared to pay 1000s.Corporate: 9 block diagram, great way to demoralize the already demoralized workforce.Work: its piling on yet people keep leaving the company so now 1 person is doing the work for 2-3 people. New projects are coming through the door.Organization: very disorganized, no one seems to be doing the duties of their particular job, everyone is jumping around doing someone else's.Career advancement: You have to submit your own essay if you want to advance to another level (which comes with a measly raise), almost not worth the title because now you will be responsible for more but at a barely higher salary.Cafeteria: completely overpriced, taking advantage of employees eat-onsite to charge them high prices for low quality food. Aramak is the server.Absolutely No benefits of being a government contractor. The president of the company repeats the same mantra every meeting, ""we need to become more efficient.""No Bonus"

Mots of mentor ship opportunities if you seek out and build relationships with the right experts. Most of the employees are fun to work with. There is tons to learn if you pay attention and strive to build knowledge. cons:Benefits are horrible. Cost cutting in all the wrong places. Departments merging that have nothing to do with one another. Employees are some what beat down with RIFS and Furloughs hanging over your head all the time. Quality and customer service would suffer if the employees didn't actually care and didn't work twice as hard like they do. Its very hard to move up unless you job hop, which creates a bunch of people who are mediocre at their jobs and gaps when they move to another department."

Possibly the worst engineering company you could ever work for.Expect to see furloughs on a periodic basis while the CEO gets record bonuses for record profits. Expect to be overworked and underpaid. Expect to be asked to put in ""undocumented overtime"" so that no additional people need to be hired on.Expect to get a demerit if you use your sick time.This company is an utter joke - maybe at one point Honeywell was a great company to work for..but that was long long ago."

After all, you're just a tool. cons:You're just a tool management wishes to exploit for as long as you're willing to bow your head.No interest in solving the pressing engineering problems. You're expected to stick to ""established methods"" and agree with everything management goes with. You will be managed and led by some of the most incompetent engineers in the field, don't make the mistake of knowing too much science. That's frowned upon and you'll be targeted and your life made a living hell.The more effort you put in your work, the more devalued your time is. Political acumen will go a long way in this company. If you plan to be in engineering for a long time, don't work here for over a couple years.On the other hand, if you have aspirations for running for office or being a politician, this is a great place to work with an environment to help nurture a lot of the backstabbing sabotaging strategies and techniques needed for a successful political career.Many of the people in charge in the firm are not the managers but an elite group of clandestine members of a religious cult who seek to preserve people like them and rid the place of outsiders like you.

Due to the implementation of lean and 6Sigma throughout the company, Honeywell has been able to build a strong reputation for quality products. cons:Several years of reorganizations, furloughs, layoffs, and managements refusal to fill key positions have negatively impacted the company's once strong culture. Employees all over the U.S. have been forced to do more with less, have had multiple changes in leadership, and have watched their colleagues be RIF'd all around them.

So what's wrong? Top Leadership at this location for one and everyone coming to visit having different opinions on the same subject (HOS). Creates chaos and eliminates company loyalty."

1x4h6g,"pros:Historically strong company with diversified portfolio. Good 401k program and solid stock performance. cons:The company is generally out of touch with its employees.

My direct manager is good.Projects are fast-paced and exciting.Vacation time is sufficient. cons:You'll hear about companies that are all about the bottom line and making money for the executives - that is Honeywell.Health benefits are AWFUL. Deductible is very high, and you get no assistance whatsoever until you meet the deductible. No copay assigned for a doctor's visit, so you'll be paying $100+ for every appointment until you meet your deductible.Executives are out of touch with employees. When there is a problem, the solution is to throw the ""12 Behaviors,"" ""Honeywell User Experience,"" ""Honeywell Operating System,"" and ""HPD Goals"" in employees' faces, instead of addressing underlying problems.Most employees are urged to ""stay off the radar"" of senior managers, directors and executives, leading to a stressful and distrusting work environment.Most divisions have layoffs and furloughs throughout the year, leading to low morale within the company."

0y5n6n,"pros:close to home and convenient for me cons:low moral, work ethics questionable"
4a3b4f,"pros:There is opportunity to move around the company but it is difficult to spend the time looking given it is an extremely busy environment. cons:The company has reduced or deferred raises over the past several years, aggressively passed on health care cost to the employees, have lay-offs and furloughs and cut employee recognition expenses. HR treats the employees like dirt and they work for the managers and not the people. Losing much of the Aerospace business to Rockwell Collins, GE and Garmin. These actions to increase op margins a few tenths of a percent are paying a huge toll on the employee morale and productivity."
